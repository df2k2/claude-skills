# Changelog - Hyvä Checkout

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.10...main)

## [1.3.10](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.9..1.3.10) - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Resolve Alpine CSP Errors When Guest Checkout Is Disabled**

Fixes an issue where disabling `checkout/options/guest_checkout` resulted in Alpine CSP errors appearing in the browser console during checkout.

The issue was caused by reusing theme-based checkout login components that are not fully compatible with Alpine’s CSP-friendly build when guest checkout is disabled.

To resolve this, we introduced **dedicated checkout-specific login layout and template overrides**:

- A new layout handle: `hyva_checkout_customer_account_login`
- A custom login form template: `Hyva_Checkout::overrides/Magento_Customer/form/login.phtml`
- A login template with Alpine initialization: `Hyva_Checkout::overrides/Magento_Customer/form/login-component.phtml`

Please note that this is only a **temporary** fix until we introduce [In-Checkout Login/Register Workflows](https://www.hyva.io/roadmap?product=hyva-checkout#design-ux-user-experience-in-checkout-login-register-workflows) in a future release.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #546](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/546).

### Changed

- **Prevent Modal Closure When Clicking Pre-Loader in Address Form**

Adds a fix for an issue where interacting with the pre-loader mask while adding a new address during checkout would unexpectedly close the modal.

The fix ensures that clicking the pre-loader no longer interrupts the address entry process, allowing the loading state to complete while keeping the form open and usable.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #543](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/543).

- **Enable Address Modal Form Submission via Enter Key**

Fix an issue where the new address form modal could not be submitted using the Enter/Return key on desktop or the "Go" button on mobile keyboards.

The fix restores default form submission behavior by listening to the form submit event instead of the button click event, allowing keyboard-based submission while preserving existing JavaScript validation.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #522](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/522).

Many thanks to Wout Kramer (Youwe) for the contribution!

- **Fix TypeError When Saving Empty Street Address with Single-Line Street Configuration**

Fixes an issue in Hyvä Checkout where saving a new shipping address with "Save in address book" enabled would throw a TypeError when "Number of lines in a street address" is set to 1 and the street field is left empty.

The issue occurred because an empty street value was passed as an empty string instead of an empty array, causing Magento’s `Address::setStreet()` method to fail due to strict type expectations.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #539](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/539).

- **Ensure Checkout Reinitializes Correctly After External Cart or Address Changes**

Adds improved handling and test coverage for cases where the checkout state becomes inconsistent after external changes such as modifying the cart or adding a new customer address outside of checkout.

The fix ensures the checkout session is properly reset and reinitialized in the following scenarios:

```
- When a customer adds a new address via "My Account"

- When cart items are removed or modified outside the checkout

- When returning to checkout after external navigation without changes

- When quote-level changes require checkout state refresh
```

For more information, please refer to [merge request #532](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/532).

Many thanks to Stuart Otter (Aware Digital), Adam Wacławczyk (Snowdog) & Raul Verdugo (PHPro) for the contribution!

- **Preserve Expanded Address List State After Adding New Address**

Fixes an issue where the "Show all / Show less" toggle state for saved customer addresses would reset after adding a new address during checkout.

When a customer with multiple saved addresses expands the address list ("Show less" state), adding a new address incorrectly caused the UI to revert the toggle back to "Show all", collapsing the expanded view.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #538](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/538)

Many thanks to Renze Dijkstra (E-Tales) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.9](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.8..1.3.9) - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **Pre-Populate Checkout Name Fields for Logged In Customers**

Adds an experimental feature that automatically pre-populates the checkout name fields (prefix, first name, middle name, last name, and suffix)
for logged-in customers using their account details.

The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled via **Stores > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Developer > Experimental > Enable Pre-Populate Checkout Name Fields for Logged In Customers**.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #287](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/287).

- **Improved Multi-Tab Checkout Stability with Stale Data and Empty Cart Detection**

Introduces deferrable dialog events to handle out-of-sync checkout state across multiple browser tabs.
When the cart is emptied in another tab, customers are now prompted to refresh the page rather than being left in a broken checkout state with no shipping methods.
A stale checkout data dialog is also introduced to handle cases where checkout information has changed in the background, replacing the previous `multi-tabs-compatibility.phtml` template with a more robust deferrable dialog pattern.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #529](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/529).

Many thanks to Filipe Bicho (Refusion) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Fix Order Summary Thumbnail for Configurable and Grouped Products**

Fixes an issue where the order summary in checkout always displayed the parent product thumbnail for configurable and grouped products,
ignoring the **Stores > Configuration > Sales > Checkout > Shopping Cart > Configurable Product Image** setting.

The correct child product thumbnail is now resolved using Magento's `ItemResolverInterface`, consistent with how the cart page handles thumbnails.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #484](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/484).

Many thanks to Chris Bogaards (Aravis) for the contribution!

- **Fix Shipping Method Title Returning Phrase Instead of String**

Fixes an issue where shipping method or carrier titles defined as translation phrases were not being cast to strings in `MethodList::getMethodTitle()`,
despite the method's `string` return type.

This could cause unexpected behaviour when carriers return `Magento\Framework\Phrase` instances instead of plain strings. A `(string)` cast has been added to all return paths.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #515](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/515).

- **Fix Missing `autocomplete` Attribute on Guest Checkout Email Field**

Fixes an issue where the `autocomplete="email"` attribute and email validation rule were only applied to the guest email field when the login option was enabled,
leaving them missing for guests checking out without the login flow. Both are now applied unconditionally.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #530](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/530).

Many thanks to Jason Leeuwis (MaxServ) for the contribution!

- **Upgrade Magewire Dependency to v1.13.3**

Updates the minimum required version of `magewirephp/magewire` from `^1.13.2` to `^1.13.3`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #517](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/517).

- **Fix Checkout Flow Broken After Login When Customer Has Saved Addresses**

Fixes a regression where logging in during checkout would break the checkout flow for customers with saved addresses and no active quote.

The `customer_login` event observer for checkout session reset was previously removed, causing customer addresses not to be assigned to the active quote and resulting in missing billing address validation errors.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #518](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/518).

Many thanks to Sander Jongsma (Emico) for the contribution!

- **Fix `hyva_checkout_quote_id_changed` Event Dispatching on Every `setQuoteId` Call**

Fixes an issue where the `hyva_checkout_quote_id_changed` event was dispatched on every call to `setQuoteId` because `$latestChangedId` is always `null` on initialisation,
making the comparison always true. The condition now checks that `$latestChangedId` is set before comparing it to the new quote ID,
ensuring the event is only dispatched when the quote ID has genuinely changed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #520](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/520).

Many thanks to Sander Jongsma (Emico) for the contribution!

- **Fix `importCustomerAddressData` Being Called Twice on Billing Address**

Removes a duplicate call to `importCustomerAddressData` in `EavAttributeShippingAddress`, where the billing address was being imported from the shipping address data twice unnecessarily.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #523](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/523).

Many thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for the contribution!

- **Fix Missing Focus Ring on Input Group Addon/Icon**

Fixes an issue where the focus ring was missing on input group addons and icons. The `--form-stroke` CSS variable was previously defined on child elements only, meaning it was unavailable at the parent level where it was needed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #524](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/524).

- **Fix Show Password Icon Alignment in Guest Details Component**

Fixes a misalignment of the show password button in the guest details component when using Tailwind CSS v4. The input group now enforces a merged border style by removing the inline-end border on all but the last child element.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #525](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/525).

- **Fix Checkout Session Error Modal Appearing Behind Page Header**

Fixes an issue where modal popups on the checkout page had no z-index applied, causing them to render behind page headers or other elements with a higher stacking context.
Adds `z-50` to the error modal overlay to ensure it always appears on top.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #527](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/527).

Many thanks to Vikash Kesarwani for the contribution!

### Removed

- **Remove Unused `$customerAddressFactory` from `AddressRenderer`**

Removes the unused `$customerAddressFactory` property and its `CustomerAddressInterfaceFactory` dependency from the `AddressRenderer` class as it was never referenced.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #519](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/519).

Many thanks to Giacomo Moscardini (Webgriffe) for the contribution!

## [1.3.8](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.7..1.3.8) - 2025-12-15

### Added

- Nothing Added

### Changed

- **Fix Tailwind 4 Warning for `@screen` Usage**

Resolved a console warning related to deprecated `@screen` usage when using Tailwind CSS v4.
The fix updates the syntax to the correct Tailwind 4 format. The issue did not impact functionality.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #512](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/512).

- **Fix Exception Handling in Place Order Redirect Flow**

Fixed an issue where throwing an exception in the `getRedirectUrl` method of a Place Order service caused a `TypeError` in the checkout step resolution logic.
The error occurred when `Checkout::getStepAfter()` received a `null` step.

With this fix, exceptions thrown during redirect URL resolution are handled correctly, allowing the order to be placed as expected without triggering a checkout flow error.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #511](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/511).

Many thanks to Michiel Gerritsen (Control Alt Delete), Ezra Botter (FRMWRK) & Aleksandr Yegorov for the contribution!

- **Fix JavaScript Error When Toggling Billing/Shipping Address Checkbox**

Fixed a JavaScript error `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'split')` that occurred when toggling the "My billing and shipping address are the same" checkbox multiple times during checkout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #513](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/513).

Many thanks to Martijn Bakker for the contribution!

- **Fix Missing Shipping Price When Displaying Excluding Tax**

Resolved an issue where the shipping method price disappeared from the label when `tax/display/shipping` was set to "Excluding Tax".
This bug only affected the display label and did not impact the actual pricing calculation.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #510](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/510).

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.7](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.6..1.3.7) - 2025-12-02

### Added

- **Add Back to Cart Button for One Page Checkout Layout**

Added an option to display a "Back to Cart" button in the Hyvä One Page checkout layout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #480](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/480).

### Changed

- **Fix Payment Method (Re-)Initialization Issue on 1.3.6**

Resolved a problem introduced with the new Payment API in version `1.3.6` where certain JS-driven
payment methods failed to initialize or re-initialize correctly.

We've also improved backwards compatibility for payment methods still using the `activate` method
to register JS-driven payment methods, ensuring they are now correctly initialized and re-initialized.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #508](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/508).

- **Fix Magewire Component Loading Error Outside Checkout on 1.3.6**

Resolved an issue introduced in version `1.3.6` where Magewire components used on non-checkout pages would fail to
load and throw an exception due to missing Step History data.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #507](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/507).

Many thanks to Arjen Miedema (JC-Electronics) for the contribution!

- **Update Checkout Form Input Styles to Match Theme ^1.4.0**

Fixed an issue where form input fields in the checkout did not fully reflect the styling introduced in
Hyvä Default Theme version `^1.4.0`. Inputs now match the theme’s design, ensuring a consistent look
across the checkout page.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #506](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/506).

- **Improve Wrapping for Long Shipping Method Names**

Fixed an issue where long shipping method names (e.g., Free Shipping with a long label) did not
wrap properly on the checkout page.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #505](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/505).

- **Fix Hover Underline Spacing in Sign In / Register Links**

Corrected an issue in `signin-register.phtml` where extra whitespace caused the "Sign in" link
underline to extend beyond the text. The markup and spacing have been adjusted so hover underlines
now appear only under the actual link text.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #504](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/504).

Many thanks to Richard Brown for the contribution!

- **Clarify Price Display with Tax in Checkout**

Fixed an issue where certain tax configurations caused multiple, confusing price values to appear on the checkout page.
The update ensures prices are clearly labeled and easy for customers to understand, indicating whether they include or exclude tax.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #503](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/503).

- **Standardize Options for Hyvä Checkout Message Methods**

Updated `hyvaCheckout.message.*` and `hyvaCheckout.messenger.*` methods so that all message functions consistently support
the same options, including `duration`. Previously, methods like `dispatch` ignored the `duration` option,
leading to inconsistent behavior when displaying messages.

Note: The `duration` option is now supported in the checkout code, but may still not work correctly due to a bug in
the theme's message handling (`hideAfter` timeout). This is being investigated and should be fixed in a future theme release.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #502](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/502).

Many thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for the contribution!

- **Fix Duplicate Shipping Method Prices When Displaying Including Tax**

Resolved an issue where shipping method prices were shown twice on the checkout page when `Sales -> Tax -> Display Shipping Prices`
was set to `Including Tax`. Previously, both inclusive and exclusive prices appeared even when the configuration did not request it.
This update ensures only the correct price is displayed according to the store settings.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #501](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/501).

Many thanks to Jason Leeuwis (MaxServ) for the contribution!

- **Ensure Totals Are Updated When Selecting First Available Shipping Method**

Fixed an issue when the admin config `hyva_themes_checkout/developer/experimental/enable_first_shipping_method_available` was enabled,
selecting the first available shipping method did not update totals if the method had a shipping cost.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #500](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/500).

Many thanks to Sander Jongsma (Emico) for the contribution!

- **Messenger Fixes and Improvements**

Made several enhancements to the `hyvaCheckout.messenger` API.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #499](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/499).

Many thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for the contribution!

- **Upgraded Magewirephp to version 1.13.2**

For more information, please refer to [Magewire 1.13.2](https://github.com/magewirephp/magewire/releases/tag/1.13.2).

- **Prevent 500 Error for Magewire Requests Outside Checkout**

Fixed a bug where Magewire requests using the `hyva_checkout` resolver on non-checkout pages could trigger a 500 error
due to uninitialized checkout state. Requests now safely handle missing navigator data without throwing errors.

The resolver now verifies that the navigator has valid checkout and step data before processing requests, and the navigator's
`boot` method replaces `start` to avoid incrementing the "checkout entering attempts" counter unnecessarily. This improves
tracking of actual user checkout entries and page refreshes, making debugging and understanding navigator state more reliable.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #486](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/486).

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.6](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.5..1.3.6) - 2025-11-04

### Added

- **Introduce Frontend JavaScript Payment API for Improved JS-driven Payment Methods**

We've significantly revamped the way JS-driven payment methods are built since version `1.3.6`.

This introduces a more robust and flexible frontend Payment API, providing a better developer experience for JS-driven Payment Methods.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #491](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/491).

- **Add new Tailwind v4 CSS file for compatibility**

A new Tailwind v4 CSS file has been added to ensure compatibility between Tailwind v4 and Theme v1.4.
If you see `Unknown at rule: @screen` when building with Tailwind v4, upgrade to this version or follow the Tailwind v4 guidance in [TailwindCSS Troubleshooting → `Unknown at rule: @screen`](../../hyva-themes/working-with-tailwindcss/troubleshooting.html#unknown-at-rule-screen-on-tailwind-v4-builds) and the [Easier Styling and Future-Proofing](../../hyva-themes/upgrading/upgrading-to-1-4-0.html#easier-styling-and-future-proofing) section of the 1.4.0 upgrade guide.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #496](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/496).

### Changed

- **Fix error classes not applied to Terms & Conditions field on validation failure**

We identified an issue where the error styling (`text-red-600`) was not being applied to the Terms & Conditions field when validation failed.

This has now been fixed, and the appropriate error classes are applied correctly when validation fails.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #495](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/495)

Many thanks to Karol Litman (9bits) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.5](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.4..1.3.5) - 2025-09-18

### Added

- Nothing Added

### Changed

- **Fix message is not defined console error**

We identified a regression in `1.3.4` that triggers an `Uncaught ReferenceError: message is not defined` error in the console.

This did not affect checkout functionality, but to avoid the console error, we have now applied a fix.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #475](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/475).

- **Shipping total config option inverted**

The new `Show shipping total when no method selected` admin config hides the total if no shipping method has yet been selected.

This logic was previously inverted. It has now been fixed if you set the option to `NO`, you will no longer see the shipping total until you choose a delivery method.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #474](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/474).

Many thanks to Jordan Gimbel (ATI4 Group) for the contribution!

- **Fix Inconsistent wrapping in Shipping & Payment Method Icons**

Previously, when a shipping or payment method had a long label, the accompanying icon became vertically misaligned and was pushed onto a separate line.

This has now been fixed so that icons remain properly aligned regardless of label length.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #477](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/477).

- **Fixed PHP TypeError in non-zero payment methods config**

A `TypeError` occurred when Hyvä Checkout attempted to retrieve non-zero payment methods for a `null` value, breaking the checkout flow.

This has now been fixed by handling null values correctly.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #479](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/479).

Many thanks to Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contribution!

- **Made "State/Province" placeholder translatable**

The placeholder text "Please select a region, state or province." could not be translated via i18n CSV files.

This has now been fixed, and the text can be translated as expected.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #481](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/481).

Many thanks to Emils Malovka (Magebit) for the contribution!

- **Fixed an error when a shipping method does not have a name specified**

Updated `getMethodTitle()` to handle cases where the method title may be empty.

The logic now falls back to the carrier title if the method title is not set, and combines both if the design configuration allows.

This ensures we always return a string and display something meaningful.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #488](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/488).

Many thanks to Jordan Gimbel (ATI4 Group) for the contribution!

- **Improved product summary attributes accessibility & semantics**

Product summary attributes were not using proper semantic markup, which could cause accessibility issues.

These have now been updated to use more appropriate elements.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #489](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/489).

Many thanks to Alexey Motorny (Amasty) for the contribution!

- **Fixed issue with reorder checkout for logged-in users**

Logged-in users were unable to place an order using the “Reorder” functionality, as shipping methods were not displayed in the checkout.

This has now been fixed, allowing users to successfully reorder and complete checkout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #490](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/490).

Many thanks to Anastasiia Bondar for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.4](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.3..1.3.4) - 2025-07-16

### Added

- **Feature to Set a Custom Redirect Template via Place Order Service**

A new feature was introduced to allow setting a custom redirect template when placing an order via a custom Place Order Service.

By using the `withRedirectTemplate(string)` method, developers can now specify a custom `.phtml` template that will render when redirecting after order placement.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #470](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/470).

Many thanks to Ole Hornauer (Oval Media) for the contribution!

- **Config to Control Display of Shipping Total Before Method Selection**

A new configuration option was added to control whether the shipping method total is shown when no shipping method has been selected yet.

Previously this would show the shipping cost as `$0.00` or `Free` which can be confusing for customers.

By default, this setting is enabled to maintain the existing behavior after upgrade. Disabling it will hide the shipping total until a method is selected:
`hyva_themes_checkout/design/formatting/show_shipping_method_total_if_none_selected`

For more information, please refer to [merge request #469](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/469).

Many thanks to Nick Hall (MFG Supply) for the contribution!

- **Config to Display Carrier Title and Method Name Together**

A new configuration option was added to allow displaying the carrier title and method name together in the shipping method list.

This feature is disabled by default to avoid unexpected formatting changes during upgrades. To enable it, set the following config to `true`:
`hyva_themes_checkout/design/shipping_payment_methods/combine_shipping_method_name`

For more information, please refer to [merge request #463](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/463).

Many thanks to Kostadin Bashev (Webcode) for the contribution!

- **Added Frontend Data Validation for Telephone Field**

This update adds frontend validation to all telephone inputs.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #425](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/462).

Many thanks to Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Fix for Missing Evaluation Message on Purchase Order Number**

A regression was fixed where the evaluation message for the required "Purchase Order Number" field was not displayed when using the "Purchase Order" payment method with an empty field.

This issue was introduced in the 1.3.0 upgrade and only occurred on fresh quotes — refreshing the page would restore the expected validation behavior.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #468](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/468).

- **Fix to Prevent Fallback Checkout Errors with Incorrect Theme Fallback Configuration**

We've added a fix to prevent frontend errors when the Hyvä Checkout is used alongside the Hyvä Theme Fallback module and the fallback configuration is incorrect.

Previously, if `checkout/index` was listed in the fallback paths, the following errors could occur: `Main wire element could not be found`

This often resulted in the Luma checkout being shown unexpectedly, leading to a poor experience, especially for new customers setting up Hyvä Checkout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #467](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/467).

- **Fix for Error When Country Field is Disabled in Checkout Address**

A fix was added to resolve an error that occurs when the country field is disabled in the checkout address configuration.

This happened when disabling the country field, for example, if the store only delivers to a single default country.

This fix ensures that when the country field is disabled, the checkout correctly uses the default country without triggering this validation error.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #466](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/466).

Many thanks to Rik Willems (Actiview) for the contribution!

- **Fix for Missing Use of Translation Function**

A fix was added to ensure proper use of Magento’s translation functions and phrase collection using the `i18n:collect-phrases` command.

For more information, please refer to:
[merge request #401](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/401)
[merge request #461](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/461)

Many thanks to Giacomo Moscardini (Webgriffe) & Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contribution!

- **Fix for UnhandledMatchError in `currencyWithLabelingConditions()`**

A fix was applied to prevent an `UnhandledMatchError` that could occur in `Hyva\Checkout\ViewModel\Checkout\Formatter::currencyWithLabelingConditions()`.

The error occurred when the `$result` from the currency condition was neither a `string` nor an instance of `Phrase`.

A default case was added to ensure fallback behavior by calling the base `currency()` method.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #460](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/460).

Many thanks to Christoph Hendreich (In-session) for the contribution!

- **Fix for Address List Items Always Inactive in `list.phtml`**

A fix was added to address an issue where list items in `address-list/list.phtml` were always inactive in the checkout address selector.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #458](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/458).

- **Shipping Method List Now Updates When Applying Coupon Codes**

Previously, when a discount code was applied that enabled free shipping, the updated shipping methods were not reflected in the shipping method list.

This update enables the listeners to update the shipping method list when a coupon code is applied, eliminating the need for a page reload.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #356](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/356).

Many thanks to Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contributions!

### Changed

- **Performance Optimization in Observer Conditional Logic**

A performance improvement was made by reordering `if` conditions to ensure the least expensive calls are executed first.

Previously, the observer logic always called `getActiveCheckout()` first, even on pages where it wasn't necessary.

By reordering the conditionals to short-circuit early, this optimization prevents unnecessary logic from running on every page load.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #442](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/442).

Many thanks to Igor Wulff (Youwe) for the contribution!

- **Loader Trigger Behavior Update**

A fix has been applied to `hyvaCheckout.loader.start()` trigger the checkout loader as expected.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #455](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/455).

- **Swapped Console Log Evaluation Processor for Executable Result**

The browser console log mechanism has been refactored from an evaluation processor into a standalone executable result (`checkout.browser.console-log`).

For more information, please refer to [merge request #453](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/453).

- **Fixed DOM Attribute Reflection for Relative Form Fields**

Fixed an issue where class attributes (e.g. class-wrapper, class-element) were not being correctly applied to fields rendered relative to a parent form.

This ensures visual and behavioral consistency for nested form fields such as multi-line street address inputs.

Also, standardized disabled state styling to `disabled:opacity-60` to match other checkout components.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #451](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/451).

- **Improved Accessibility for Shipping Method Missing Error**

When no shipping method is selected and the user attempts to proceed to the next step, an error message is displayed.

This message was previously not announced by screen readers. This has now been fixed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #449](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/449).

- **Fix Default Billing and Shipping Address Checkbox Behavior**

For logged-in customers "Billing and shipping address are the same" checkbox was incorrectly pre-selected when a customer’s default billing address differed from their default shipping address.

Now, the checkbox is only pre-selected when the billing and shipping addresses are the same.

If the customer has different default addresses, the checkbox is unchecked, and the correct default billing address is displayed during checkout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #448](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/448).

Many thanks to Olaf Caspers (Trinos) for the contribution!

- **Improved Checkout Step Condition Evaluation Performance and Readability**

Refactored the `\Hyva\Checkout\Model\Checkout\StepConditions::assertSuccess()` method to improve performance and reduce complexity.

The new implementation uses a `foreach` loop with early returns, enabling short-circuit evaluation of checkout step conditions.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #446](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/446).

Many thanks to Jean-Bernard Valentaten (techdivision) for the contribution!

- **Fix: Duplicate `id="shipping"` Preventing Auto-Save Directive from Resolving Correctly**

Resolved an issue where two nodes in the checkout shared the same `id="shipping"`, which caused the Magewire `wire:auto-save` directive to target the wrong element.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #445](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/445).

Many thanks to Tobias Hartmann (Basecom) & Daniel Galla (iMi digital GmbH) for the contribution!

- **Enhanced Street Address Field Labels with Configuration-Aware Context**

Improved the rendering of street address form fields by adding contextual labels based on system configuration.

This change addresses the ambiguity of generic validation messages (e.g., "This field is required") that can arise when street fields are rendered as multi-line inputs.

By applying clearer labels to each individual line of the street address field, users now receive more intuitive validation feedback.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #441](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/441).

- **Resolved Tooltip Visibility Issue via z-index Adjustment and Template Tag Consideration**

Fixed an issue where tooltips could be partially hidden due to overlapping elements. This was caused by insufficient `z-index` layering.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #418](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/418).

Many thanks to Christoph Hendreich (In-session) for the contribution!

- **Updated Boolean Object Handling for CSP Compatibility**

Aligned the checkout implementation with changes introduced in [hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module#454](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module/-/merge_requests/454), which simplifies `hyva.createBooleanObject(...)`.

This update ensures consistent behavior between CSP and non-CSP environments, resolving the issue where `!something` was incorrectly transformed into a non-function falsy value in non-CSP mode.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #400](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/400).

- **Prevented Accidental Form Submission in Guest Details Component**

When the “Enable Login” option is disabled for the guest details component, pressing Enter after entering an email address would submit the form as a GET request to the current URL.

This update prevents unintended form submissions by explicitly disabling default submit behavior for the component when login is not enabled.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #450](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/450).

Many thanks to Daniel Galla (iMi digital GmbH) for the contribution!

- **Improve evaluation timing to ensure all processors and results are registered**

The evaluation is now triggered on `init:after` instead of `init:evaluation` to allow proper registration of processors and results before execution.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #457](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/457).

### Removed

- Nothing Removed

## [1.3.1](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.3.0..1.3.1) - 2025-05-08

### Added

- **PHP 8.4 Support for Magento 2.4.8**

Hyvä Checkout is now compatible with PHP `8.4`, Magento/Adobe Commerce `2.4.8` system requirements. This update includes
necessary adjustments for deprecations and stricter type enforcement introduced in PHP `8.4`.

Projects running Magento `2.4.8` can now use Hyvä Checkout with PHP `8.4`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #424](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/424).

- **Support for Redirect-Only Payment Methods**

Hyvä Checkout now supports the `getOrderPlaceRedirectUrl` method in the Quote payment model (`\Magento\Quote\Model\Quote\Payment::getOrderPlaceRedirectUrl`).

This ensures compatibility with payment service providers (PSPs) that rely on redirect-only payment flows without requiring additional compatibility modules.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #421](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/421).

Many thanks to Michiel Gerritsen (Control Alt Delete) for the contribution!

- **PlaceOrderService for Multiple Payment Methods**

The `PlaceOrderService` now supports handling multiple payment methods dynamically based on their method code.

Previously, a separate `PlaceOrderService` had to be registered in `etc/frontend/di.xml` for each individual method even
when using the same service class.

This introduces a matcher method in `PlaceOrderService` that allows it to handle multiple payment methods dynamically,
based on their method code. This removes the need to register the service per method and keeps the Hyvä integration in sync automatically.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #420](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/420).

Many thanks to Michiel Gerritsen (Control Alt Delete) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Improved Navigation Handling and Alpine Component Support**

Navigation Tasks can now be scoped to specific navigation directions. Developers can control execution using `whenNavigatingForwards`,
`whenNavigatingBackwards`, and `whenNavigatingBothWays` methods on the Navigation Task evaluation result.

Dynamic Alpine.js components now automatically initialize when loaded via Magewire. This ensures alpine components
such as payment methods behave correctly even when injected dynamically.

Additionally, the next and previous steps are now injected into the checkout config. This resolves issues where refreshing the
page on a later step caused the previous step to be unavailable. You can now reliably use `hyvaCheckout.navigation.getNext()`
and `hyvaCheckout.navigation.getBefore()` by accessing the injected step history via `hyvaCheckout.config.getValue()`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #425](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/425)

- **Auto-Save Directive Now Supports Checkboxes and Radio Buttons**

The `auto-save` directive now correctly detects changes to checkboxes and radio buttons.

Previously, it only observed `element.value`, which caused changes to these input types to go unnoticed—preventing the
auto-save functionality from triggering.

With this fix, the directive correctly uses `element.checked` as the value for checkboxes and radios, ensuring auto-save behavior across all input types.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #419](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/419).

- **Mobile Checkout UX Improvements**

To improve clarity on mobile devices, the text “Order Summary” has been changed to "Review Your Order." This helps set clearer expectations that further action is required on this step.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #416](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/416).

Many thanks to Ryan Hoerr (ParadoxLabs) for the contribution!

- **New Config Option: Show Free Shipping Label**

A new system configuration setting has been added to optionally display a "Free Shipping" label during checkout.

**Config path:** `hyva_themes_checkout/component/shipping/free_shipping_label_enabled`

This allows merchants to easily highlight free shipping options to customers.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #415](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/415).

- **Fix: `checkout:payment:method-activate` Event Behavior**

In versions `1.2.0` and lower of Hyvä Checkout, the `checkout:payment:method-activate` event was dispatched when switching
from the payment page to the shipping page and then back to payments. A regression was introduced in `1.3.0`.

The issue is now resolved, and the event will be properly dispatched again for both shipping/payment methods.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #414](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/414).

Many thanks to Michiel Gerritsen (Control Alt Delete) for the contribution!

- **ACL Resource Identifier Mismatch in Admin Menu**

A mismatch in the ACL resource identifier was causing the Hyvä Checkout configuration to disappear from the admin menu when using custom role permissions.

With this fix, the Hyvä Checkout configuration will now be visible when using custom role permissions.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #413](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/413).

Many thanks to Samuel Jozwiak (Nola Consulting) for the contribution!

- **Fix: Missing Fallback for Email Address Tooltip in Guest Details**

An issue was identified in the Shipping Address Form component, where if the `Email Address Tooltip` field in the
Guest Details component group was left empty while the setting was set to `Yes` it would not fall back to the Luma tooltip text.

This behavior has been fixed, ensuring that when the `Email Address Tooltip` field is empty, the Luma default tooltip text will be used as a fallback.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #412](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/412).

Many thanks to Akif Gumussu (Aquive) for the contribution!

- **Conditional Customer Session ID Regeneration in Checkout**

The Customer Session ID will now only be regenerated during checkout for insecure requests or requests with an insecure reference.

This improvement maintains security by ensuring that a Session ID is regenerated only when necessary, specifically in cases where insecure HTTP connections are used in non-checkout pages.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #393](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/393).

For more information, please refer to [merge request #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383)

- **Back To Cart Button**

Added `Show Back to Cart Button` which can be configured in the admin to appear, this gives the user the ability to
return to the without needing to use the browser back buttons. (This is disabled by default)

This setting can be found under **Store > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Navigation > Show Back to Cart Button**.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383)

- **New Tooltip Style**

A new design option for tooltips now allows content to be displayed beneath the main field for improved clarity and
accessibility. The classic tooltip style remains available, along with the hint text display option, both of which can
be managed in the admin settings. These updates enhance usability, accessibility, and aesthetics, ensuring a smoother
and more user-friendly checkout experience for all users.

This setting can be found under **Store > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Design > Form Fields > Tooltip Style**.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383)

- **New Breadcrumb Design - Progress bar**

A new breadcrumb design can now be configured in the admin to appear as a progress bar stepper, providing a more visual
and intuitive navigation experience. The classic breadcrumb style remains available and can also be managed in the admin settings.
(This is disabled by default)

This setting can be found under **Store > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Breadcrumbs > Breadcrumbs display**.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383)

- **Shipping Method Icons**

Introduced support for adding metadata to shipping methods, enabling the inclusion shipping provider logos.
Metadata allows shipping methods to be extended with additional frontend features without requiring modifications to
the Magento shipping method object. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and improved customization options shipping methods.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #381](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/381)

### Changed

- **Checkout UX Design Refresh**

Enhancements to the overall checkout experience with a focus on both visual design and accessibility improvements.
The updated design includes refined visual styles, improved spacing, and clearer form elements, all aimed at making the
checkout process more intuitive and user-friendly.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383)

- **Improved Translation Support for Navigation Steps**

Removed the use of `mb_strtolower` for navigation step labels, which previously forced button labels (e.g., "Shipping")
to display in lowercase. This change ensures that translated phrases retain their correct capitalization and formatting,
improving support for multilingual storefronts.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #380](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/380)

Many thanks to Ole Hornauer (Oval Media) & Martin Nguyen (Jajuma) for the contribution!

- **Correct Missing list semantics**

Addressed an accessibility issue in Safari where list-style: none removes list semantics, making it inaccessible to screen
readers. The solution involves adding role="list" or wrapping the list in a `<nav>` element to preserve semantics. Updates
have been applied to the default theme in v1.3 to ensure compliance and improve accessibility.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #361](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/361)

- **Fixed Backward Compatibility Issue in 1.1.29**

In 1.1.29, we introduced the Zero Subtotal Checkout: Hide Other Payment Methods feature. However, this included a backward-incompatible change.

This issue has now been resolved.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #408](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/408)

Many thanks to Pieter Hoste (Baldwin) & Leon Hagendijk (MaxServ) for the contribution!

### Removed

- **Remove redundant main role on hyva-checkout-main for improved accessibility**

This is a backward incompatible change. Previously, `#hyva-checkout-main` had a `role="main"` attribute, which could affect
queries relying on `role="main"` for targeting elements. This change was necessary to prevent accessibility issues caused
by multiple main elements on the page.

If your customization or JavaScript relies on `role="main"` being present on `#hyva-checkout-main`, update your selectors accordingly.

For more information, please refer to [issue #383](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/383).

### Added

- **Billing Address Display Configuration**

Resolved an issue introduced in version 1.1.28 where checking the "My billing and shipping address are the same"
checkbox no longer copied the shipping address to the billing address. This occurred because the shipping address
had not yet been saved.

To address this, we have introduced a new system configuration option:
`hyva_themes_checkout/developer/fixes_workarounds/render_billing_address`

When enabled (default), this option removes the shipping address from above the billing address selection component.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #400](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/400).

Many thanks to Joost Wanetie (Trinos) & Daniel Galla (imi) for the contribution!

- **Admin Toggle for Field Autosave in Address Forms**

Enhanced the Shipping and Billing Address Form in the admin area by adding an auto save checkbox for each field.
When enabled, the field will autosave upon user input. This allows administrators to selectively enable autosaving for
specific fields.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #398](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/398)

- **Disable Form Auto Saving Configuration**

The form auto-saving feature has been a core part of Hyvä Checkout since its inception. As development progressed, more
third-party integrators began designing their solutions with auto-saving in mind. Consequently, some third-party systems
now depend on this feature, making it essential to keep auto-saving enabled. Disabling it could lead to potential
compatibility issues with these integrations.

To address this, we have introduced a new system configuration option:
`hyva_themes_checkout/developer/fixes_workarounds/disable_form_auto_saving`

When enabled, this option completely disables the form auto-saving mechanism, which may impact third-party integrations
relying on this functionality. However, if you choose to disable auto-saving, you can still manually configure specific
fields to auto-save as needed.

By default, auto-saving remains enabled, so users upgrading from version `1.1.26` or earlier do not need to take any action.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #405](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/405)

- **Zero Subtotal Checkout: Hide Other Payment Methods**

Improved the checkout experience by ensuring that when a customer's cart is eligible for the Zero Subtotal Checkout
payment method, all other payment options are hidden. This ensures a seamless checkout process by automatically
applying the zero subtotal payment method to the quote.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #353](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/353)

### Changed

- **Address Form Keyboard Tabbing Auto-Save Update**

Resolved an issue where the address form would update when tabbing through fields, even if the country selection
remained unchanged. This caused a disruptive user experience as the loading process interfered with input in the next
field. The fix ensures that the address is only updated when relevant changes are made.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #397](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/397)

Many thanks to Pim de Brabander (iO) for the contribution!

- **Scroll to Correct Element on Checkout Validation Failure**

Resolved an issue where the checkout validation correctly identified when required sections were incomplete, but
failed to scroll to the correct element. This fix ensures that users are automatically directed to the relevant
section when validation fails, improving the overall user experience during checkout.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #387](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/387)

Many thanks to Nathan Day (Wind & Kite) & Adrien Lagrange (Nola Consulting) for the contribution!

### Removed

- **Removing the last form autosave remains**

An autosave timeout is no longer required moving saving into a Evaluation API navigation validation task. This has now
been removed from the admin config, please see `\Hyva\Checkout\Magewire\Component\AbstractForm::build()` instead.

### Changed

- **E-mail Validation Errors**

Resolved an issue where the email address component would throw `500` errors when the configuration
`hyva_themes_checkout/component/guest_details/enable_login` was set to `No`. This error occurred during checkout when an
invalid email address was entered and changed to another invalid email before proceeding. The fix ensures that email validation
errors are now properly displayed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #388](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/388)

Many thanks to Stijn Jansen (Trinos) for the contribution!

- **Sensitive Details Exposure in URL on Guest Login**

Resolved a regression from Alpine.js `v3.14.4` and newer that impacted the Guest Details component. This issue specifically
affected users who upgraded to `hyva-themes/magento2-theme-module:1.3.10` and had "Enable Login" activated at checkout.
The regression caused the first login attempt to fail, exposing sensitive details such as email and password in the URL,
which posed a potential security risk. This fix ensures that login attempts are securely processed without exposing credentials.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #386](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/386)

Many thanks to Mihai Ardeleanu (innobyte) & Jacques Kirchner for the contribution!

- **Improved Context Usage for Payment Method Availability**

Enhanced the `isAvailable()` function for payment methods by passing the current quote model when it is already available.
This improvement allows payment methods to consider the current quote context when determining their availability, enabling
dynamic adjustments based on quote details. For example, the "Zero Subtotal Checkout" payment method (`method code: free`)
relies on the quote context to determine its availability. This update ensures more accurate payment method visibility
across various scenarios.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #378](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/378)

- **No Price Displayed for Shipping Methods with Default Tax Settings**

Resolved an issue where Magento's default tax settings caused no price to be displayed for shipping methods. This was due to
the `/view/frontend/templates/checkout/shipping/method-list.phtml` template lacking a fallback price. The fix ensures that
shipping methods always display a price, even when the default tax settings are in use.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #379](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/379)

- **Corrected Sort Order with "Enable First Available Shipping Method Automatically"**

Resolved an issue where enabling the experimental feature "Enable first available shipping method automatically" caused the
sort order of shipping methods to be ignored. This resulted in the wrong shipping method being preselected instead of the
first method in the sorted list. This fix ensures that the preselected shipping method now correctly follows the defined sort order.

- **Read `hyva_checkout.xml` Files from All Frontend Themes**

Resolved an issue where custom checkout configurations in a theme's `etc/hyva_checkout.xml` file were ignored unless the
theme was active or an ancestor of the active theme. This fix ensures that checkout configurations are correctly loaded
across multiple store views, regardless of the theme used to populate the cache.

Many thanks to Ruben Zantingh (E-Tales) for the contribution!

### Removed

- **Removed automatically saving for Magewire driven forms**

Until version `1.1.27`, auto-saving forms in Hyvä Checkout was an automated process. This ensured that form data was
always synchronized with the server, optionally required by other components like the price summary.
While this approach guaranteed all data was readily available at all times, we realized that only a small subset of data
is typically necessary for the checkout to function properly. Therefore, we removed the auto saving feature on forms
and have adjusted this concept, giving developers greater control over which data is stored.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #375](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/375)

## [1.1.26](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.25...1.1.26) - 2024-10-04

### Added

- **Automatic Selection of First Payment and Shipping Method**

After careful consideration, we've introduced a feature that automatically selects the first payment and shipping
methods upon entering the checkout. These options can be enabled or disabled independently and are initially placed
under an experimental flag.

We’ve done this intentionally, as issues may arise when the first method relies on JavaScript, potentially missing
expected triggers and causing errors. We recommend enabling these settings only if you're confident your payment
or shipping methods (e.g., those built with Magewire) can handle them.

Both settings can be found under **Store > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Developer > Experimental**.

Please note, these features are disabled by default and must be enabled manually.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #158](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/158)

### Changed

- **Scope Parameter for Terms and Conditions Configuration**

A scope parameter has been added to the terms and conditions configuration lookup to resolve an issue where other T&C settings were required.

For more information, please refer to [issue #339](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/339)

Many thanks to Bert ter Heide (iO) for the contribution!

- **Evaluation Error Message validation remove listener**

A bug slipped in where when a Evaluation Error Message result was used, the validation stayed in place event when the user
would interact with the component to solve the issue which cause the validation error message in the first place. A listener
has been added to the Error Message result type processor, to check if the component can remove that particular validation.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #363](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/363)

Many thanks to Tobias Hartmann (basecom GmbH & Co. KG) for the contribution!

- **Experimental Fix for Magewire Evaluation Hydrator**

We’ve introduced an experimental fix for the Magewire Evaluation Hydrator. Previously, when an update request was
made to the Main component, evaluation results from all child components were merged and sent with the response to
ensure the checkout recognized their states.

This addressed some niche issues where for example, after failing to accept the terms and conditions and attempting
to place an order, an error would occur. If the user accepted the terms and tried again, the Main component would
incorrectly recheck the conditions, leading to an endless validation loop unless the page was refreshed.

The fix now wraps the child result merging in a system setting (enabled by default), preventing the merge with the Main component’s response.

You can find this setting under **Store > Configuration > Hyvä Themes > Checkout > Developer > Experimental**.

No action is required when upgrading to this or later versions.

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.25](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.24...1.1.25) - 2024-09-20

### Added

- **Cascading Step Validation**

We've introduced a new feature that validates each step in the multi-step checkout process. This ensures that all
required steps are completed and no components requiring specific validations trigger errors or exceptions.
This enhancement is part of a broader initiative to reduce the data stored in session, giving users more flexibility
to navigate through the checkout process.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Configurable Redirect timeout to Order Success Page**

Previously, customers were automatically redirected to the order success page after three seconds. This behavior is
now fully configurable, allowing you to set a custom redirect timeout that suits your needs.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Enhanced Custom Evaluation Result Types**

Creating a custom evaluation result type tailored to your specific needs now comes with more refined controls.
We've introduced two new result capabilities that allow you to orchestrate your workflows with greater precision:

`TaggingCapabilities`: This feature allows you to tag a result type with a unique identifier, enabling better grouping or further distinction.
`SequenceCapabilities`: Added to help orchestrate tasks by ensuring a navigation step is executed before proceeding with further navigation or order placement.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Added a MessageDialog Evaluation Result Type**

As of version 1.1.18, a new `hyvaCheckout.message.dialog()` JavaScript API was introduced, providing developers
with a universal way to display a dialog box. This includes a title, text, cancel- and confirmation button,
all of which can be extended with custom callbacks. Now, this functionality can also be triggered from the PHP side,
allowing you to return a `MessageDialog` evaluation result from your component. This is useful for scenarios such as
handling validation failures or guiding customers through the next steps in the checkout process.

This API has been further extended with powerful methods, notably the `withConfirmationCallback()` method, which
allows you to inject an `Executable` evaluation result type, that runs when the customer presses the confirmation
button—bringing powerful backend-driven control to your front-end dialog interactions.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **New `Sequence` Capability for Validation Result Type**

We've added a new `Sequence` capability to the existing `Validation` evaluation result type, giving developers more
control over the order of validations. This allows you to specify whether a validation should be run before or after another,
prioritizing certain checks as needed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Introducing the `modify()` Method for Enhanced Form Customization**

With the new `modify()` method, you can now apply additional form modifications by passing a callable.
This is particularly useful in scenarios where a form has been instantiated and requires adjustments without the
need for a separate form modifier object.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Navigator ServerMemoConfig object**

Hyvä Checkout now allows developers to pass data from the backend to the frontend with every Magewire round trip.
In addition to Step History data, it now supports Navigator data, which includes details about the current and previous steps.
This data is automatically synced with the `hyvaCheckout.config` API, ensuring that developers always have access to
the latest Navigator data on the frontend, for example by using `hyvaCheckout.config.getValue('navigator.history.current')` to
get the route name of the current step.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

### Changed

- **Expanded Functionality for Batch Evaluation Results**

The Batch evaluation result has taken on a more significant role in results that can be carried with a Magewire component state.
To support this, we've extended this result type with new methods, giving developers more flexibility when working with batches.
You can now search for specific elements or determine if something should be added using the following methods: `filter()`, `containsFailureResults()`, and `containsSuccessResults()`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Enhanced Custom Evaluation Result with Argument Support**

As the need for custom evaluation results grew, we saw an opportunity to enhance this result type further.
Developers now have the flexibility to add additional argument data using the new `withArguments()` method, offering
more control and customization options.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

- **Email input group validation bugfix**

Version 1.1.19 introduced a new advanced form validation feature for Hyvä Checkout called `validateGroup`.
This addition allows developers to validate only fields assigned to a specific group, avoiding unnecessary validation
of optional fields.

For example, a password field should be validated when pressing the login button,
but not when placing an order if the user is already registered by email. This feature helps streamline navigation
between steps without over-validating irrelevant fields. A bug related to this feature has also been identified and fixed.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #349](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/349)

### Removed

- **Deprecation of Blocking Evaluation Result in Favor of Error Message Result**

Since the initial release, a blocking evaluation result type has been available in the core product,
allowing developers to completely disable the primary navigation button. However, it placed the responsibility on
developers to provide additional feedback, such as error notifications.

While blocking seemed useful for preventing further actions, it often left customers confused about what to do next.

To improve user experience, we’ve decided to deprecate the blocking result and replace it with an error message result type.
Now, instead of blocking, the system will display a default notification instructing customers that they must interact
with the checkout to proceed. If a blocking result previously included a specific "cause", that text will be shown instead
of the default one, providing clear and direct guidance.

For developers currently using the Blocking result, no immediate action is required when upgrading to this version of the checkout.
The transition will happen automatically. However, we strongly encourage developers to update their implementations by
replacing the Blocking result with an Error Message for a clearer and more user-friendly experience.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #357](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/357)

## [1.1.24](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.23...1.1.24) - 2024-09-10

### Added

- **Guest Details for Virtual-Only Checkout**

The Guest Details component, introduced in version 1.1.12 for most checkout variants,
is now also available for the virtual-only checkout.

For more information, please refer to [issue #340](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/340)

Many thanks to Vladyslav Sikailo (run\_as\_root GmbH) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **SVG Rendering and Icon Description Improvements**

SVG rendering has been improved by utilizing HTML width and height attributes,
and missing icon (SVG) descriptions have been resolved.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #290](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/290)

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.23](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.22...1.1.23) - 2024-08-14

### Added

- **Re-instated a Collect Totals for Order Summary (experimental)**

We conducted extensive research on the necessity of triggering a totals recollection for the order summary component.
Randomly applying totals recollection in your code is not recommended, and we strongly discourage it. To ensure the
correct rendering of the order summary, we implemented the recollection at a single point in the code.

Note: This has been done cautiously, with a conditional statement that allows it to be disabled if issues arise during upgrades.
We are actively working on a more robust solution, with an upgrade to Magewire V3 likely being the best approach.
This upgrade will avoid single requests for each emit listener by batching them into a single request.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #327](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/327)

### Changed

- **Comprehensive i18n/en\_US.csv Translation Fixes**

Fixed various translation-related issues, including avoiding null coalescing operators, correcting grammar,
removing superfluous entries, adding missing frontend translations, and resolving escaping problems in the
`i18n/en_US.csv` file.

- **Checkout Address Reset on Page Reload**

Fixed an issue where reloading the checkout page resets customer address information to the default address, caused by
changes in the navigation flow that incorrectly reassigned the customer's saved information during the checkout process.

For more information, please refer to [issue #312](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/312)

Many thanks to Antoni Tormo (Onestic) for the contribution!

- **Non-clickable Previous Breadcrumbs Steps**

Fixed an issue where, in a multi-step checkout with more than two steps, previous breadcrumb steps were not clickable.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #350](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/350)

Many thanks to Antoni Tormo (Onestic) for the contribution!

- **Terms & Conditions Header Display on Empty List**

Fixed an issue where the Terms & Conditions header was displayed even when no terms and conditions were available.
The component now has its own dedicated space within the Quote Actions component, including its own Messenger.

For more information, please refer to [issue #303](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/303)

- **Place Order Button Not Working Due to Missing Default Shipping Address**

Fixed an issue where the 'Place Order' button would not work if a customer had a default billing address but no
default shipping address, due to failed validation of null shipping address fields. Customers had to reload the
page or revisit the checkout for the button to function properly.

For more information, please refer to [issue #256](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/256)

Many thanks to Mitchel van Kleef (Made By Mouses) for the contribution!

- **Address Modal Closing During Interaction**

Changed the address modal behavior to prevent it from closing when a user clicks on an input field immediately
after selecting a country in the dropdown menu during checkout. The modal will now stay open, ensuring a smoother interaction.

For more information, please refer to [issue #321](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/321)

Many thanks to Jeroen Noten (iO) for the contribution!

- **Correct Handling of Address Prefixes**

Fixed the address prefix field handling. Previously, selecting a prefix would save numeric values to the database.
Now, prefixes are saved and displayed correctly as text.

For more information, please refer to [issue #320](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/320)

Many thanks to Daniel Galla (iMi digital GmbH) for the contribution!

- **Support for Special Characters in Payment Method Titles**

The process will now complete successfully, even with empty strings.

For more information, please refer to [issue #306](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/306)

Many thanks to Federico Arroyo (Growlobby) for the contribution!

- **Exception in CountryAttributeField Method**

Fixed an exception error in the checkout process related to the `getOptions()` method in the `CountryAttributeField` class.
This method now correctly handles its arguments, preventing the error. Alongside options are now stored in memory to
prevent all options being fetched multiple times.

For more information, please refer to [issue #282](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/282)

Many thanks to Maxim Ganses (PHPro) for the contribution!

- **Enhanced Payment Method Image Icon Rendering**

Enhanced the `Hyva\Checkout\Model\MethodMetaData\IconRenderer` class to fully support rendering both SVG icons and
additional image formats alongside payment method names. Alongside, changes were made to the abstraction preparing
it to be migrated to shipping methods also.

For more information, please refer to [issue #279](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/279)

- **Saving Changes to Custom EAV Attributes**

Fixed an issue where not all changes to custom EAV attributes in the system configuration were being saved when
updating multiple attributes at once in the shipping/billing address forms. All modifications are now reliably saved.

For more information, please refer to [issue #268](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/268)

Many thanks to Fronius for the contribution!

- **Corrected Billing Address Street as String Handling**

Fixed an issue where, in some scenarios, the billing street data was passed as a string to the address save service,
causing an exception and preventing the correct saving of billing street information. The street handling has now been
migrated from the shipping save service to the billing save service to resolve this issue.

- **Upgrade to Magewire v1.11.1**

Magewire version 1.11.1 has been released, addressing specific requirements to resolve [issue #321](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/321)..
For comprehensive details on this release, please visit the [official release page](https://github.com/magewirephp/magewire/releases/tag/1.11.1).

For more information, please refer to [merge request #337](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/337)

- **Re-introduced Step and Layout Classes for Main**

During release 1.1.18, the checkout process was updated to manage steps using the Navigator, replacing the previous
session-based approach. An observer that handled two additional classes for the main component was not migrated to
use the Navigator, resulting in missing classes. This issue has now been resolved, reintroducing the `step-{step_name}`
and `step-layout-{layout_name}` "css" classes.

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.21](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.20...1.1.21) - 2024-07-12

### Added

- **Added `modifyFields()`, `modifyElements()`, `modifyField()`, and `modifyElement()` methods for Forms**

Added four new methods to the `Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\AbstractEntityForm` class to simplify the application of
repeated changes to all fields and/or elements, as well as to individual fields and/or elements.
This enhancement reduces code repetition, making form modifiers more readable, and allows changes to be applied
without checking for their existence, further clarifying and streamlining form modifiers.

Optionally, the new methods handle nested item relatives.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #288](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/288)

### Changed

- **Added Missing Label to "Save in Address Book" Checkbox**

### Changed

- **Fixed Uninitialized Class Properties in Checkout Model**

Class properties `$name`, `$label`, and `$hash` in `\Hyva\Checkout\Model\Checkout` were missing default values,
leading to a $name must not be accessed before initialization exception on new checkout installations.
This fix assigns default values to these properties, resolving the issue.

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.19](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.18...1.1.19) - 2024-07-04

### Added

- **Introducing `validateGroup` Method for Selective Field Validation**

A new `validateGroup(group)` method has been introduced to the guest details form. This method will later be migrated
to all other checkout forms. Additionally, a merge request for the theme module is planned to potentially make this
feature globally available for [Advanced Form Validation](https://docs.hyva.io/hyva-themes/writing-code/form-validation/javascript-form-validation.html).

This feature enables validation of only the necessary fields required to proceed to the next step or place the order,
initially for the Guest details component. For example, if a customer enters their email address and is identified as
an existing customer but does not fill in the password, clicking "Login" will require the password field to be mandatory.
However, this requirement will not apply when attempting to navigate to the next step.

This allows you to add a `data-validate-group` attribute to the element. For example, if the value of this attribute is
`guest-details`, you can validate only these fields by calling `validateGroup('guest-details')`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #315](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/315)

### Changed

- **Reapplied Body Checkout Name Classes (since 1.1.18)**

Significant changes have been made to the step management system for checkout and its steps in release 1.1.18.
The session-based approach has been deprecated, which means that those who relied on it will no longer receive the correct data.
This issue affected the body classes, where an observer added the checkout name as a class alongside inherited classes.
This problem has now been resolved.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #313](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/313)

Many thanks to Cian Castillo (DevTeam Outsourcing) for the contribution!

- **Reverted Development Test Code for Displaying Exceptions in Production**

While testing the new notification dialogs for displaying Magewire-specific messages instead of using a
Magewire-embedded modal for exceptions, we overlooked reverting the test code that checks if the system
is in production mode. This has now been corrected. As a result, you will see an exception message in
developer mode and a customer-friendly error notification in production.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #309](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/309)

- **Added Missing Z-Index to Backdrop for Terms and Conditions**

A `z-30` class was added to the Terms and Conditions modal backdrop.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #303](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/303)

- **Unescaped Terms and Conditions Text**

Previously, the Terms and Conditions text was always escaped, which prevented the use of HTML elements such as href
and line breaks. This limitation has been addressed by implementing the `getIsHtml()` method, ensuring that text is
only escaped when necessary.

For more information, please refer to [issue #299](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/299)

- **Fixed Guest Order Name Storage Issue in Magento 2.4.3-p3**

Resolved an issue where guest orders placed on Magento 2.4.3-p3 did not store the customer's first and last names in
the database, resulting in these fields being set to NULL. This caused the names to be omitted from the order view in
the admin, displaying "Guest" instead. This behavior was inconsistent between the Hyvä checkout and the Luma checkout.

For more information, please refer to [issue #288](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/288)

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.18](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.17...1.1.18) - 2024-06-07

### Added

- **Universal Messaging Dialog**

We’ve introduced a new `hyvaCheckout.message.dialog()` API to provide a native method for delivering essential
information to customers about specific processes. This dialog can queue multiple messages, allowing users to
navigate through them using pagination.

The message dialog replaces numerous modals cluttering the DOM tree and bloating the HTML. We plan to transition
certain existing message modals to this new universal format in the near future. All Magewire error `confirm()`
dialogs have already been replaced.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #304](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/304)

- **Executed after for Navigation Tasks on Place Order**

We’ve included a automatic dispatch of the `executeAfter()` for Navigation Task evaluation results that are injected
by native or custom Place Order Services. This ensures that every injected navigation task will only be executed
after the place order process has succeeded. Previously, this had to be done manually; now it has been automated.
For instance, if you want to display a 3DS verification dialog via JavaScript right after the order is placed but
before the customer is redirected to the success page, this is now handled automatically by default.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #286](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/286)

- **Navigation history**

Thanks to Magewire, navigating between steps feels like using a SPA (Single Page Application) without any page loads.
Now, with the introduction of a URL route-driven step management system (see: Session-driven checkout config removal),
we can make great use of the native browser History API. Each successful step is pushed into the history,
allowing customers to move back to a previous step using the browser's forward and backward buttons.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #305](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/305)

### Changed

- **Session-driven checkout config removal**

A major task we’ve been anticipating for a while has finally been addressed. Before this release, the navigation state
of the checkout was stored within a specific session, which was automatically managed as soon as the customer entered
the checkout or navigated between steps.

This has been completely removed, meaning navigation state data is no longer stored in the session; it is now managed
by the URL route step parameter. We’ve ensured backward compatibility, so customers using a session-driven checkout
won’t lose their state during deployment.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #305](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/305)

- **Step condition `remove` fix**

We’ve introduced significant improvements to the `hyva_checkout.xml` converter in `1.1.17` release, enhancing features
like multi-level checkout inheritances. During this refactor, a bug was introduced where conditional layout handle
items were still applied even if they were marked with `remove="true"`. We released a patch the day after the initial

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.17](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.16...1.1.17) - 2024-05-13

### Added

- **Checkout step `clone` attribute**

We've introduced the capability to clone steps from a particular checkout without requiring it to be explicitly
defined as a parent. This feature empowers you to craft a checkout without the necessity of inheriting from a parent
while still being able to include one of its steps seamlessly, eliminating the concern of managing data changes.

Steps can be cloned by utilizing the `{checkout_name}.{step_name}` value for the `clone` attribute within a `step` element.

It's worth noting that overwriting data such as the label, layout, and so forth is still feasible.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #278](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/278)

- **Coupon `code` for applied and revoked Magewire emit events**

Now, the actual coupon code is included in both the `coupon_code_applied` and the `coupon_code_revoked` Magewire emit events.
This enhancement grants developers the ability to listen for an emit event within JavaScript using `Magewire.on('{event_name}')`
and effectively interact with the coupon code provided by the customer.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #272](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/272)

### Changed

- **Form field previous value improvements**

We encountered some edge cases where the previous value did not align correctly with the current value set in the field.
This discrepancy resulted in conflicts when attempting to make form changes based on a comparison of value changes.
To resolve this issue and enhance reliability, we have implemented adjustments to the Form API.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #266](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/266)

Many thanks to Tjitse Efdé (Vendic) for the contribution!

- **Multi-level checkout inheritance improvements**

We encountered an issue where inheriting from a checkout more than two levels deep caused problems in copying all data
from upper level checkouts, rendering it ineffective. Essentially, although inheriting from a parent checkout was
already possible without restrictions, only the checkout data would be inherited, with elements such as parent layout
update handles left out. We've addressed this issue along with other minor edge cases.

Many thanks to Rajeev K Tomy (integer\_net) and Edwin Bos (Cream) for the contribution!

- **Order success message visibility fix for mobile**

Under normal circumstances, after a successful order placement, customers are presented with a view that includes a
message indicating redirection within a few seconds. This behavior also applied to mobile users.
However, if the "place order" button was located towards the bottom of the screen, the viewport wouldn't automatically
scroll to the top to provide users with a clear view of the impending action. This issue has now been resolved.

For more information, please refer to [issue #272](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/272)

Many thanks to Arko Rietdijk (Betersport) for the contribution!

- **Replaced the 404 response config dialog**

We've enhanced the user experience by replacing the confirmation dialog in the `404` Magewire update response with a sleek Hyvä modal.

We've upgraded to Magewire `1.11.0` to support Magento `2.4.7`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #241](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/241)

- **Form renderers Image, URL, Reset and Radio**

We've added new form options to create elements such as images, URLs, and reset buttons, along with the radio field.
The 'reset' form button is inherited from the button template, while the others now have their own templates.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #271](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/271)

### Changed

- **Navigation button UTF-8 label support**

Many thanks to Mykola Orlenko (integer\_net GmbH) for the contribution!

- **Upgraded the "Save in address book" form element**

We've updated the 'Save in address book' feature to utilize the latest Form API rendering. Now, the checkbox is
rendered using the checkbox template, resulting in a significantly smaller component template and greater
composability via layout XML.

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.15](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.14...1.1.15) - 2024-03-14

### Added

- **Multi tab out-of-sync notification modal**

Implemented a new feature that actively monitors navigation changes, such as proceeding forwards or backwards within steps,
or completing an order transaction. This enhancement includes the introduction of an 'out of sync' notification modal,
which promptly alerts users in inactive browser tabs when multiple checkout sessions are concurrently active across different tabs.

For more information, please refer to [issue #251](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/251)

Many thanks to Robert Duffner (FindCanary) for the contribution!

- **Missing Cash On Delivery method template**

Integrated the missing Cash On Delivery method template, allowing for seamless rendering of any backend system-provided instructions.

For more information, please refer to [issue #254](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/254)

Many thanks to Adam Sarkadi (Baldwin) for the contribution!

- **Evaluation executables callback params**

Since version `1.1.13`, significant enhancements have been made to our Evaluation API, particularly focusing on flexibility and functionality.
Notably, we've introduced the capability to inject JavaScript-driven executables, which are essentially registered callbacks on the frontend.
These callbacks execute based on instructions from the Magewire component, enriching the frontend experience.
In this release, we've further refined this feature by adding support for passing arguments to these executable callbacks,
thereby enhancing their versatility and utility.

For more information, please refer to [issue #259](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/259)

- **Top destinations for country select**

Administrators within the Magento system have the capability to designate top destinations, which were previously not
reflected in the country select dropdown on checkout address forms. In this update, we've introduced the functionality
to automatically include these specified countries at the top of the list, followed by all others.

For more information, please refer to [issue #234](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/234)

Many thanks to Dennis Volkering (Web4exposure) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Re-introduction of the save address checkbox**

In response to user feedback, we have reinstated the 'save address' checkbox, inadvertently removed since release `1.1.13`.

For more information, please refer to [issue #258](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/258)

Many thanks to Nick Ottens (Elgentos) for the contribution!

- **Blocking evaluation result unblocking fix**

When encountering a blocking evaluation result type, the primary navigation buttons were previously disabled to
prevent customers from clicking them, ensuring data integrity and accuracy. However, this resulted in potential
navigation restrictions for users even after resolving any issues. In this release, we've addressed this by
implementing a mechanism where blocking result types can now dynamically unblock themselves upon receiving a
different result from the server. This allows for smoother navigation and order placement,
ensuring a more seamless user experience.

For more information, please refer to [issue #262](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/262)

Many thanks to both Matthijs Perik (Ecomni) and Klaas van der Weij (iO) for their contribution!

- **Tax detail extension attribute type annotation naming violation**

We've resolved a type annotation naming violation that previously triggered errors in Swagger.

For more information, please refer to [issue #246](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/246)

Many thanks to André Flitsch (Pixel Perfect) for the contribution!

- **Enterprise: Fixed a Gift Wrapping summary total rendering issue**

We've successfully addressed an issue where the rendering of the gift wrapping summary total would break due to the
inability to locate an extension attribute block caused by a wrong return type. This problem had broader implications,
but we've rectified it without introducing any backward incompatible changes.

For more information, please refer to [issue #249](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/249)

Many thanks to James Anderson (United Wheels) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.14](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.13...1.1.14) - 2024-03-04

### Added

- Nothing added

### Changed

- **Password validation for guest authentication**

With the unveiling of the new Guest Details component, existing customers now have the opportunity,
under specific circumstances, to authenticate using their email addresses if they are already present in the database.

However, the password field previously imposed the same stringent password strength validation as the one utilized
on the registration form. We have since revised this requirement, making it required only.

- **Reversion of Breaking Change in Place Order Services Abstraction**

During the release of version 1.1.13, an unintended breaking change occurred wherein the Place Order Service abstraction
unexpectedly returned a `false` result instead of the expected `true`.
Consequently, this release rectifies the issue, eliminating the necessity for a previously released patch.

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.13](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.12...1.1.13) - 2024-02-23

### Added

- **Frontend Config + Storage APIs**

In this update, two new objects have been added to the Frontend API, enabling developers to access specific configurations
injected from the backend. Additionally, the Storage API now provides a mechanism for storing data in the browser's session storage.
Notably, this data is automatically integrated into the Place Order Service, facilitating payment integrators in securely
passing credit card information to the service without the need for server-side storage, thereby ensuring PCI compliance.

- **Clickable abstract form element**

Introducing an abstraction for all clickable form elements, applicable to various elements including URLs and buttons of all types.

- **Magewire abstract form component**

The Magewire component abstraction has undergone a complete overhaul, integrating all insights gathered regarding form requirements,
including action execution and modifications. This refined abstraction layer has already been applied in the Guest Details component,
released in version [1.1.12](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/releases/1.1.12), and is set to migrate to the current
shipping and billing forms, enhancing their functionality without necessitating overwriting the object itself.

This updated abstraction remains fully backward compatible with existing forms while introducing several new modification hooks,
such as `form:mount:magewire`, `form:execute:submit:magewire`, `form:data:updating:magewire`, and `form:data:updated:magewire`.

Additionally, it incorporates a dynamic hook for clickable form elements, enabling custom methods like `form:execute:{custom_method_name}:magewire`.
For instance, a custom button such as a "Sign In" button can trigger the `form:execute:sign_in:magewire` form modification hook.

- **YesNoForce config source model**

An addition of a custom `YesNoForce` source model provides admin select elements with an extra 'Force' option.

- **Three Evaluation API capability traits**

Three new Evaluation API capability Traits have been introduced for utilization in custom Evaluation Results.

The first capability, `StackingCapabilities`, enables the execution of evaluation results at specific positions.
For example, if you need to execute two frontend functionalities, with one preceding a core functionality and the
other following it, you can use the `withStackPosition()` method to achieve this.

The second capability, `BlockingCapabilities`, allows a custom evaluation result to block primary navigation buttons
by simply utilizing the `asBlocking()` method.

The final capability, `DispatchCapabilities`, empowers developers to dispatch a particular evaluation result immediately
after the Magewire XHR response returns to the frontend. This capability enables actions such as displaying a specific message directly,
rather than waiting for validation failure during the customer's attempt to proceed to the next step or place an order.

- **Six Evaluation API result types**

The Evaluation API has been an integral part of the core from the outset, primarily serving to evaluate a Magewire component
during both page rendering and updates. Components can optionally implement the EvaluationInterface, allowing them to convey a
"recipe" to the frontend, which a processor would then execute accordingly.

For instance, this could involve displaying an error message due to an unfilled field as soon as a customer clicks on
a primary button like the Place Order button.

Six new Evaluation result types have been introduced, providing developers with greater flexibility to provide specific
instructions to the frontend. Among these, the `Batch` result type is particularly noteworthy.
It allows for the return of multiple instructions instead of just one, reducing the number of XHR requests to the backend.

Alongside important types such as `NavigationTask`, `Redirect`, `Validation`, `Executable`, and `Custom`, the Batch result
type stands out for its efficiency in frontend instruction management.

- **SessionStorage ServerMemoConfig object**

Introducing the 'Server Memo Config' feature, which empowers developers to inject configuration values from the backend
into the Frontend API immediately upon the Frontend API booting on the frontend. This capability allows for the injection of data,
which can now be retrieved using the `hyvaCheckout.config.getValue()` method. Specifically, the `SessionStorage` object injects
an empty array for both 'shipping' and 'payment'. These arrays serve as storage for specific payment and shipping information,
which will ultimately be seamlessly transferred to the Order Place Service.

- **Redirect notification and configuration dialog**

The Evaluation Redirect result type empowers developers to implement a Redirect awareness notification or confirmation dialog.
With the notification, customers are promptly informed about an impending redirect. In contrast, the confirmation dialog offers
customers the option to either confirm or dismiss the redirection.

- **Redirect Evaluation API system config settings**

This functionality enables store admins to configure Redirect dialog settings, including options such as enabling
notification and confirmation dialogs, specifying the text for notification and confirmation messages,
and setting the default duration for dialog visibility.

- **`After` containers for each frontend API object**

Certain JavaScript functionalities necessitate or should extend specific Hyva Checkout APIs. In each API section,
there is now a `@internal` annotation marked assisting PHTML files, ensuring their execution before any third-party code.
By utilizing these after containers, developers can inject custom code with precision, ensuring that all the required
components are in place.

- **Memoize available regions**

A slight enhancement has been implemented to optimize the performance by memoizing the available regions for a particular country.
Previously, this process would entail fetching them multiple times. Now, it is executed just once and stored in memory
for the duration of the running session, resulting in improved efficiency.

For more information, please refer to [issue #245](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/245)

### Changed

- **Main component placeOrder `$data` argument**

The `Hyva\Checkout\Magewire\Main` component, responsible for functions such as step navigation and order placement,
now has the ability to accept data from the frontend, which it subsequently passes to the associated Place Order Service.
This enhancement allows developers to store data in browser storage rather than solely on the server.

Notably, session storage is automatically transmitted to the placeOrder method within the Main component.

- **Place Order Service extended with the Evaluation API**

The Evaluation API has been expanded into the Place Order Service, enriching its functionality to offer developers
capabilities similar to those available for regular checkout components. Consequently, the place order processor is
now equipped to transmit a Redirect result type to the frontend, directing it to a designated URL while presenting a
confirmation dialog beforehand.

Another critical aspect of this extension is the ability to instruct the component to execute specific JavaScript
after the order has been placed. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios such as displaying a 3DS authentication
modal before redirecting to the PSP payment- or order success page.

- **URL form element extends from Clickable**

Given that a URL functions as a clickable HTML element, the form element has been extended to inherit from Clickable.

- **PlaceOrderServiceProcessor marked as @internal**

The `Hyva\Checkout\Model\Magewire\Payment\PlaceOrderServiceProcessor` is now designated as `@internal`, indicating to
developers that they should refrain from utilizing it for their own payment methods and instead leave the order placement
to the Main component.

- **`isVisible` wrapped for form select elements**

A visibility bug concerning form select elements, which lacked a wrapping `if` statement to determine whether the
element should be rendered, has been resolved.

- **`messagesSuccessListener` component messenger event listener**

The `Hyva_Checkout::page/messenger.phtml` component accessory, which may be found within the shipping and billing forms,
now has the capability to listen for a success event. This enhancement empowers developers to hide the message using
JavaScript when it is no longer necessary.

- **AbstractPlaceOrderService `getData()` method added**

The place order service has been enhanced with a `getData()` method, which retrieves a `Hyva\Checkout\Model\Magewire\Payment\AbstractOrderData`
object containing the data passed when the customer pressed the Place Order button.
This method facilitates retrieval of payment data stored in the session storage.

- **Fixed totals return segment items of type TotalSegmentInterface**

An issue has been addressed wherein the `\Hyva\Checkout\ViewModel\Checkout\PriceSummary\TotalSegments::getTotals()` method
was expected to return an array of `TotalSegmentInterface[]`. However, it previously returned `array[]` due to a sorting
operation applied to the final array.

- **Guest login component**

We're happy to unveil our latest addition: a sleek new component inspired by the familiar guest login feature found in the Luma checkout.
This component seamlessly integrates both an email address field and an optional password field.
The password field will dynamically appear if the email address corresponds to an existing customer and/or if the
login feature is enabled in the backend component configuration.

### Added

- **Prices now include both inclusive and exclusive tax**

In this update, inclusive (incl.) and exclusive (excl.) tax prices are now concurrently displayed across various
components, including shipping methods and the price summary, when the configured backend settings are applied.
Unlike the previous versions, that limited visibility to either inclusive or exclusive tax prices, the enhanced
feature allows for the simultaneous presentation of both. The inclusive tax price takes precedence as the primary
figure, with the exclusive price displayed as its child, appropriately labeled with the exclusive tax name.

For more information, please refer to [issue #177](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/177)

Many thanks to Jeroen Balk (Adwise) for the contribution!

- **Form element accessory rendering**

We've extended the so-called "form element accessory" functionality giving the option to render your own accessory,
which can be a label, tooltip or comment. Accessories may be seen as support elements to clarify e.g. inputs helping
the customer to make better choices when interacting with the form. Out of the box, we now support the rendering of
labels, tooltips, before- & after container. The `renderAccessory` method has now been opened up.

- **Added a "Billing as shipping address" emit event**

Regardless of the toggle value for 'My billing and shipping address are the same', the billing component will now
consistently emit a `billing_as_shipping_address_updated` event, providing a point of observation within
other Magewire components.

For more information, please refer to [issue #219](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/219)

Many thanks to Ryan Hoerr (Paradox Labs) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Corrected display of shipping price after a page refresh**

Resolved a bug in the shipping price display, where selecting a shipping method initially resulted in an accurate
summary with correct shipping prices. However, upon refreshing the page, the displayed price would change to
an incorrect value. This issue has been identified and successfully addressed in this update.

For more information, please refer to [issue #200](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/200)

Many thanks to Dave Kleijn (Accent Interactive) for the contribution!

- **Price totals summary update after address switch**

Resolved an issue where the price summary failed to update when selecting an address with varying tax rates,
such as from a different country. This fix ensures that the summary now promptly updates when the customer switches
to an address with distinct tax conditions.

For more information, please refer to [issue #235](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/235)

Many thanks to Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contribution!

- **Price totals summary update shipping costs upon saving the address**

Addressing [issue #235](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/235), price summary display has
been rectified to accurately reflect the correct prices.

For more information, please refer to [issue #224](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/224)

Many thanks to Nick Hall (MFG Supply) for the contribution!

- **Price totals summary update on billing address select**

In certain scenarios, the price total summary needed an update when a billing address was saved or an existing
billing address was selected. To address this, we've introduced two new Magewire listeners: `billing_address_saved`
and `billing_address_activated`. These listeners ensure that the price total summary is now appropriately updated in
response to these billing address events.

For more information, please refer to [issue #239](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/239)

Many thanks to Aad Mathijssen (iO) for the contribution!

- **Checkbox renderer now includes a before and after container**

The checkbox PHTML, unlike other form input renderers, previously lacked a before and after rendering container,
preventing the inclusion of additional DOM elements right before or after a checkbox input form element.
This limitation has now been addressed.

For more information, please refer to [issue #220](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/220)

Many thanks to Jeroen Balk (Adwise) for the contribution!

- **Form modifications added multiple times during runtime**

Previously, the form initialization within the `__construct` method led to the unintended application of form
modifiers multiple times, causing an exception that was silently logged into the exception log.
To address this, we have now relocated the form initialization to the `boot` method. This adjustment ensures
that the issue no longer occurs, preventing unnecessary exceptions in the future.

### Changed

- **Fixed configurable shipping address form auto-save timeout**

Unlike the billing address form object, the `getAutoSaveTimeout` method in the shipping address form class previously
overlooked the system configuration setting. It was hardcoded with a return value of `3000`. This issue has been
rectified by updating the method to dynamically retrieve the value from the backend configuration.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #227](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/227)

Many thanks to Simon Sprankel (CustomGento) for the contribution!

- **Address attribute requirement no longer supersedes the system configuration**

We've modified both the shipping- and billing form grid configurations. With this update, these settings
will now take precedence over the `enabled` and `required` value within the attribute settings themselves.
Among other things, this allows the designation of a second street field as a required field.

*Important Note: During the upgrade, review both shipping- and billing form
configurations to ensure that all necessary fields are properly set as enabled and required.*

For more information, please refer to [issue #201](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/201)

- **Enterprise street lines support**

The display of street lines was previously determined by inspecting the `customer/address/street_lines` configuration
setting. This approach has been updated, and the number of street lines is now determined by the
`\Magento\Customer\Helper\Address::getStreetLines()` method, ensuring compatibility with Adobe Commerce.

- **Fixed region field visibility issue**

Resolved an introduced in Hyvä Checkout 1.1.8 by MR [210](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/210), where
configuring the `general/region/display_all` setting to `0` (the "Allow to Choose State if It is Optional for Country" admin setting)
no longer hid the region input for countries where states are optional.
Instead, a required text input was displayed.

- **Form input values trailing whitespaces trim**

In the past, trailing whitespace in form input values was allowed, occasionally leading to problems
during the save process. To address this, trailing whitespace is now automatically
trimmed from input values when using the `setValue()` function, mitigating potential issues during data storage.

- **Enhanced the shipping method list radio button positioning**

Previously, radio buttons were vertically centered based on the combined height of both the header and the shipping
method content block, resulting in the radio button appearing as detached or "free-floating."
This has been resolved by repositioning the radio button adjacent to the shipping method title, ensuring a more
cohesive and visually aligned layout.

- **Fixed cart unfolding issue**

We've corrected an issue where the `$canUnfold` variable was inaccurately set solely based on the
"Unfold" configuration value, disregarding the specified cart item limit threshold. With this fix, `$canUnfold` is
now accurately determined by both the "Unfold" configuration and the cart item count, ensuring it is set to `true` only
when both conditions are met and `false` otherwise.

- **Zipcode requirement by country bugfix**

We implemented zipcode requirements based on the selected country during the early stages of our Form Modification API.
At that time, the framework lacked support for multiple scenario hooks. In a later phase, we introduced additional
hooks without modifying the Zipcode requirement form modifier.
This change resolves the issue so the zipcode field is now marked as required or not correctly.

Many thanks to Cian Castillo (Vetshop group) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.8](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.7...1.1.8) - 2023-11-03

### Added

- Nothing added

### Changed

- **Street fields value spreading bugfix**

In Release `1.1.7`, a bug was introduced where the wire:model field attribute would receive the value `{field_id}.{field_id}.0`
instead of the expected `{field_id}.0`. This issue affected all fields that had one or multiple related elements assigned to them.
Consequently, Magewire was unable to correctly distribute values among these related elements, causing them to be merged into a
single value within the parent field.

- **Active CSS class isn't set for shipping- and/or billing address listing**

The active class should consistently apply to logged-in customers with one or multiple addresses in their address book.
However, this was not the case due to a discrepancy in the `x-data` attribute, where the active address ID was rendered as a string,
causing it to fail the strict comparison against the expected int value.

For more information, please refer to [issue #207](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/207)

Many thanks to Antoine Fontaine (Dn'D) for the contribution!

- **Tax summary doesn't show correct tax amount**

In Release 1.1.7, a new feature was introduced, allowing the rendering of price summary item extension attributes through a layout XML renderer.
However, the initial renderer we introduced had a calculation error for each rate, which has now been corrected.

For more information, please refer to [issue #206](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/206)

Many thanks to Chathura Maduranga (Supply App) for the contribution!

- **State/Province fields required status not updated as per country configuration**

The region field was not adhering to the store configuration settings for determining when it should be required.
Instead, it solely relied on the 'require' value set in the region attribute. This issue has been resolved.

For more information, please refer to [issue #205](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/205)

Many thanks to Nathan Day (Wind and Kite) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.7](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.6...1.1.7) - 2023-10-31

### Added

- **Added a named navigation class to each button**

Every button in the primary navigation bar now automatically gets a named class to target each button specifically.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #97](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/97)

Many thanks to Alice Dean (Fisheye a Youwe company) for the contribution!

- **One column row Street field renderer**

In a prior release, we introduced an optional street fields renderer. When activated in the configuration, this renderer
displays the specified street fields in a grid structure. Now, you have the option to choose a second renderer type that
we've dubbed the "One Column Row" renderer, which will present the street fields in a single row.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #201](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/201)

- **Form input `hidden` renderer**

This release introduces a `hidden` input renderer which is used for hidden input form fields.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #195](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/195)

### Changed

- **Price summary item extension attribute render option**

In the past, different tax rules were shown as a single item in the totals summary component. We've expanded the
rendering to automatically include a summary item extension attributes when added as a renderer item via layout XML.
This enhancement is already in place for tax rules, which now display the rule label, price, and percentage.

For more information, please refer to [issue #199](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/199)

Many thanks to Chathura Maduranga (Supply App) for the contribution!

- **Fixed checkout hash issue**

We've resolved an issue where customers would experience a checkout reset when the `hyva_checkout` cache was cleared.
This occurred because a unique hash was associated with each generated checkout. The hash would only update if modifications
were made via `hyva_checkout.xml`. However, since all layout handles with array keys were generated through `uniqid`,
they were different each time. Now the array keys are predictable and won't change.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #203](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/203)

- **Frontend API `hyvaCheckout.config`**

This release introduces a frontend configuration API that allows directly injecting frontend configuration
settings from PHP. This API operates in a manner akin to the store configuration, offering functions like `getValue()`
and `isSetFlag()`. To inject configuration settings, you can use the `ServerMemoConfigInterface`. Notably, this configuration
object is passed as the first argument in each `initialize()` method, ready for use during frontend initialization.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #195](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/195)

- **Added form fields attribute method `removeAttributesStartingWith`**

We've introduced a new method `removeAttributesStartingWith` that is used by all form fields. It allows developers
to eliminate all attributes associated with form fields that begin with a specified string.
For instance, all Magewire-related attributes can now be removed in a single operation.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #195](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/195)

- **Rewrote Messenger Component**

We've revamped the Messenger Component API that was originally part of the messenger.phtml template.
Now it can be utilized within custom components, without relying on the messenger template.
Furthermore, we've made slight modifications to messenger.phtml so it aligns with the new API. The primary advantage
of this update is the ability to dispatch multiple messages concurrently.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #195](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/195)

- **Fixed multiple checkout session object code smells**

We have identified methods within the session configuration object that could lead to issues in very specific
situations. To enhance the developer experience, we've addressed these issues in this release.

For more information, please refer to [issue #202](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/202)

Many thanks to Thomas Hägi (Refusion) for the contribution!

- **Upgrade to Magewire 1.10.10**

The dependency constraint update to version 1.10.9 of Magewire was made to accommodate a novel feature within Magewire,
enabling the placement of custom Magewire [Hydrators](https://github.com/magewirephp/magewire/blob/main/docs/Hydrators.md) based on order numbers at specific locations within the call stack.

A dependency constraint update to version 1.10.10 of Magewire was made to leverage the new `Magewire.hasPlugin(pluginName)` method.
This was used to resolve an issue encountered during the frontend API initialization process, where an error would
occur due to the absence of the Magewire Loader plugin when it was disabled in the system configuration.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #193](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/193) and [merge request 200](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/200)

Many thanks to Jacob Nguyen (JaJuMa GmbH) for the contribution!

- **Fixed a layout handle code comment typo**

Fixed a template identifier bug in a comment. The example previously used a slash instead of the double colon syntax.

For more information, please refer to [issue #190](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/190).

Many thanks to Christoph Hendreich (In-session) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.6](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.5...1.1.6) - 2023-10-06

### Added

- **Added IntelliSense compatibility**

Restructured all PHTML files to be IntelliSense compliant in terms of `@var`, `declare` and `use`.

For more information, please refer to [issue #178](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/178).

Many thanks to Jeroen Balk (Adwise) for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Fixed Magento HTML minification**

Added multiple line ending semicolon to the default messenger PHTML to solve Magento HTML minification errors.

For more information, please refer to [issue #158](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/158).

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus (Freelancer) for the contribution!

- **Fixed selected payment method de-select after a component refresh**

Resolved an issue in certain scenarios where, following a refresh of the payment method list component,
the selected payment method was not visually highlighted, resulting in an evaluation failure.

For more information, please refer to [issue #155](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/155).

Many thanks to Christoph Hendreich (In-session) and Soham Bhosale (Hummingbird) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.5](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.4...1.1.5) - 2023-09-27

### Added

- **Allow disabling form modifiers using a null argument item**

Form modifiers are now filtered to allow for the disabling of existing modifiers within di.xml.

For more information, please refer to [issue #176](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/176).

Many thanks to Jeroen Balk (Adwise) for the contribution!

- **Allow street field labels to be configured per store**

For more information, please refer to [merge request #170](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/170)

Many thanks to Ronald Bethlehem (Freelancer) for the contribution!

- **Fields now have a `hasAttributesStartingWith` method**

You can now check if a field possesses an attribute that begins with a specific string.
This feature can be useful for determining whether a particular setting needs to be configured within a Form Modifier callback.

For more information, please refer to [issue #173](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/173)

### Changed

- **Removed Checkmo payment method content margin on empty context**

For more information, please refer to [issue #165](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/165).

- **Fixed exception on empty terms and condition message**

When the terms and conditions are configured to display a message, but no message is provided, the checkout
used to raise an exception. This issue has been resolved by requiring the config field and returning
an empty string for backward compatibility.

For more information, please refer to [issue #171](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/171).

Many thanks to Jeroen Balk (Adwise) for the contribution!

- **Upgrade Magewire from 1.10.7 to 1.10.8**

For more information, please refer to [merge request #184](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/184).

- **Call loader.stop with dummy component to avoid error**

For more information, please refer to [merge request #180](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/180).

- **Billing address shows email field only for virtual quotes**

In the past, guest users were presented with an email address form field in the shipping and billing address.
This email address was also used as the order contact email. However, this has since changed,
with the shipping email address now serving as the primary contact email for orders.
The email field for billing addresses will now only be displayed for quotes containing only virtual items.

For more information, please refer to [issue #164](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/164)

Many thanks to Rocky Notten (Wickey) for the contribution!

### Removed

- **Removed an unused `data` argument from the frontend `payment.placeOrder()` method**

For more information, please refer to [issue #118](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/118).

Many thanks to Andrzej Wiaderny (Hatimeria) for the contribution!

- **Removed dependency on default hyva-theme styles in favor of default tailwindcss classes**

This is a backward incompatible change. If you rely on a customized `text-primary` class for the breadcrumb text color,
be aware that it will change to `text-gray-800` after the upgrade. To revert the change, customize the css in your theme
to apply `text-primary` again to the selector css `#hyva-checkout-main .breadcrumbs .item`.

For more information, please refer to [issue #57](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/57).

## [1.1.4](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.3...1.1.4) - 2023-08-29

### Added

- **Added built-with HTTP response header to hyva checkout routes**

We've added an `x-built-with: Hyva Checkout` header to Hyvä Checkout pages.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #164](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/164).

### Changed

- **Improve default checkout header**

Previously the checkout used the `checkout` page layout.
This was changed to `1column` to provide better styling and improved compatibility with the Hyvä theme out-of-the-box.
To remove the top menu, search box, and customer account menu, a new header template was introduced.

This is a backward-compatibility breaking change. Please refer to the
[1.1.4 upgrade notes](https://docs.hyva.io/checkout/hyva-checkout/upgrading/upgrading-to-1.1.4.html) for more
information on how to upgrade.

For even more details, please refer to [issue #149](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/149) and
[merge request #166](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/166).

- **Fix critical error when customer enters percent sign in order comment**

Previously order comments containing a percent symbol broke rendering in the frontend and admin area.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #163](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/163).

Many thanks to Jeroen Noten (iO) for the contribution!

- **Immediately clear Magewire validation errors on user input**

Previously the error message remained visible until after the field lost focus. Now the message is hidden as soon as a
user changes the value.

For more information, please refer to [issue #162](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/162).

### Removed

- Nothing removed

## [1.1.3](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.2...1.1.3) - 2023-08-15

### Added

- Nothing added.

### Changed

- **Apply sales rules Free shipping, table-rate etc price adjustments to shipping method on address change**

Please refer to [issue #131](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/131) for more information.

Many thanks to Justin van Elst (Publicus) for the contribution!

- **Check Country and Region fields are present before applying modifications**

`Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityFormModifier\WithRegionModifier` attempted modifications on the region
field without verifying the presence of both the essential `country_id` and `region` fields on the form. This led to
issues when the fields were removed. Now they can be removed safely from address forms.

Please refer to [merge request #157](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/157) for more information.

- **Showing shipping method prices incl. or excl. tax according to configuration**

Please refer to [issue #133](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/133) for more information.

Many thanks to Justin van Elst (Publicus) for the contribution!

- **Billing address email not captured when shipping email changed**

When a guest customer enters their email address and the shipping address is the same as the billing address,
the email is processed successfully. However, when a customer then modifies the shipping email address,
the changed email was not set for the billing address.

Please refer to [issue #140](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/140) for more information.

Many thanks to Ameer Potrik for the contribution!

- **Form field method `getPreviousValue()` improved**

In the 1.1.2 release, we introduced a new form field feature to get the previous value. This feature is
handy during form updates to check if a specific field was changed. We've since noticed some flaws in the
flow, which are now improved. Also, we've added `form:boot` and a `form:{form_namespace}:boot` modification hooks
to apply changes on both preceding and subsequent form boot.

Please refer to [merge request #155](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/155) for more information.

- **Select input renderer template now uses `$key` instead of `$option`**

The template for the form field select input has been enhanced. It now uses the `$key`
variable for all string-type options. This enhancement provides developers with a more effective
approach to associating values with options, especially in cases where the `$option` variable is
dynamic or subject to change.

Please refer to [merge request #115](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/115) for more information.

### Removed

- Nothing removed.

## [1.1.2](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.1...1.1.2) - 2023-08-09

### Added

- **New form modification hooks `form:updated` & `form:field:updated`**

Two new modification hooks empower you to make alterations to forms and their fields if the modification is not
specific to a single field being updated. Previously this was achieved using distinct field hooks.

Please refer to [merge request #145](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/145) for more information.

- **Add field method `AbstractEntityField::getPreviousValue()`**

Performing comparisons to the previous field value using a modification hook proved to be challenging, often resulting in
situations where an if-statement within a form modification lacked certainty about whether a particular change should be applied.

Please refer to [merge request #145](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/145) for more information.

### Changed

- **Upgraded Magewire dependency from v1.10.5 to v1.10.7**

Please refer to [merge request #145](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/145) for more information.

- **Creating typed input fields no longer requires an input data argument**

When generating a field through form modifiers, it was necessary to include an argument containing an input key with
the corresponding input type. This approach could be perplexing, given that the method inherently demanded the `$type` to be specified.
With this change improvement, the data type is automatically assigned if it is not specified.

Please refer to [merge request #145](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/145) for more information.

- **Navigating backward via breadcrumbs bugfix**

The default navigation button allowed backward navigation without validation. However, navigating backward using the
breadcrumbs, the checkout process triggered validation, potentially preventing stepping backward to a previous step.
Now the validation is bypassed when navigating to a previous step.

Please refer to [merge request #140](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/140) for more information.

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

- **Moving wire:key from the field to its wrapper element**

Previously, Magewire faced issues in tracking changes made by form modifiers when the `wire:key` attribute was assigned
to the innermost element of a field renderer template. To address this, the key is now placed on a wrapper element.
By relocating the key, Magewire is able to accurately understand where to perform DOM morphing.
This change resolves a scenario where a text input was transformed into a select input during subsequent requests.

Please refer to [merge request #143](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/143) for more information.

- **Form field mutation check bugfix**

Preiously checking for a difference between the current address values and the updated ones would not work with null values.

Please refer to [merge request #144](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/144) for more information.

- **Checkout JS API: Fixed a missing `config` object on validation exception**

Please refer to [merge request #147](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/147) for more information.

- **Checkout JS API: Now works with the Magewire loader plugin**

The events `loader:start` and `loader:stop` no longer are dispatched to start and stop the loader.
Instead, methods on the Magewire loader are called directly. The events are still dispatched, but now from within Magewire.

Please refer to [merge request #148](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/148) for more information.

### Removed

- Nothing removed.

## [1.1.1](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.1.0...1.1.1) - 2023-07-25

### Added

- **Form field checkbox type template**

When creating and adding a form field of type checkbox, the checkbox field rendering view was missing. Now, a
dedicated checkbox template is available with the option to also render option relatives.

Please refer to [issue #144](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/144) for more information.

Many thanks to Filipe Bicho (Refusion) for the contribution!

- **Emit event Address Submitted now carrying the save result**

Previously, you could listen for a `shipping_address_submitted` or `billing_address_submitted` emit event without
knowing if the save was successful or returned `false`.
Now, an emit carries the save result giving developers the option to change course based on it.

Please refer to [issue #139](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/139) for more information.

- **Main component redirect template on order place completion**

There are situations where the Main component is trying to rerender itself despite the quote now being an order.
Because of not having the quote object, the component relying on it would possibly break. Therefore, when the PlaceOrderService
finishes the order with a redirect, the main component will render with a template notifying the customer about the redirect.

Please refer to [issue #122](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/122) for more information.

Many thanks to Francesco Marangi (Y1) for the contribution!

- **Form element label renderer**

Previously each element renderer needed to implement its own hard-coded label HTML creating inconsistency, bad maintainability
and not being able to swap a label HTML without rewriting a form element renderer. Therefore a label template has been
introduced used as the default element label renderer.

Please refer to [issue #142](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/142) for more information.

Many thanks to Tjitse Efdé (Vendic) for the contribution!

- **Shipping- & Billing street grid renderer (optional)**

Depending on the street width configuration and checkout developer settings, a new street field renderer will show
street fields in a two-column grid instead of the default, where ancestor relatives are rendered underneath each other.

Please refer to [merge request #133](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/133) for more information.

- **Added missing en\_US translations**

Please refer to [issue #117](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/117) for more information.

### Changed

- **Fix PSR-autoload standard issue**

The class `Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityField\Primary` has been renamed to
`Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityField\PrimaryKey` which matches the file name.

Please refer to [issue #141](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/141) for more information.

Many thanks to Gérald CANN (Sdkweb) for the contribution!

- **Improved default styling consistency**

The default checkout(s) now are closer to the Hyvä Theme styling having a more consistent look and feel over the
entire store.

Please refer to [issue #116](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/116) for more information.

Many thanks to Sean van Zuidam (Siteation) for the contribution!

- **Fix to show a different address book view for billing addresses**

Previously the billing address book view listened for the shipping address book view setting making it not possible to
define a different look and feel. This has been fixed and the view now uses its own config setting.

Please refer to [issue #115](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/115) for more information.

- **Creating a form field without a predefined class**

Previously creating a form field without a predefined class in di.xml was not possible. Now, a form field can be
created by giving it a name, some arguments, and an input type resulting in a field using a default implementation of
`Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityField\AbstractEntityField`.

Please refer to [issue #143](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/143) for more information.

Many thanks to Thijs de Witt (Trinos) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing removed.

## [1.1.0](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.7...1.1.0) - 2023-07-10

### Added

- **Form modification listener API**

This new API allows for a wide range of customizations to checkout address forms.
It allows callbacks to be triggered when form field values are changed, and modify the form based on it.

Please refer to the [form customization documentation](https://docs.hyva.io/checkout/hyva-checkout/devdocs/form-customization/index.html) for more information.

- **Grouping of form fields**

A form field can now be assigned as related to another field.
This causes the fields to be rendered together, as well as the values to be combined in an array (for example, the street fields use this).

Please refer to the [form customization documentation](https://docs.hyva.io/checkout/hyva-checkout/devdocs/form-customization/related-form-elements.html) for more information.

- **New checkout emit messages**

A couple of new checkout emit messages have been added.

Please refer to the [form customization documentation](https://docs.hyva.io/checkout/hyva-checkout/devdocs/checkout-emit-messages.html) for more information.

### Changed

- **Fix checkout for new customers with downloadable product or virtual product**

Previously this resulted in a stack-trace.

For more information, please refer to [issue #48](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/48).

Many thanks to Dung La (JaJuMa) for the contribution!

- **Fix unchecking "My billing and shipping address are the same"**

Previously this caused an address to be rendered as only `,,,,,,,`.

For more information, please refer to [issue #130](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/130).

- **Require Magewire 1.10.5**

This change requires the latest version of Magewire.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #116](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/116).

- **Add referer information to log-in and create an account links**

This allows customers to be correctly redirected back to the checkout after logging into their account.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #117](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/117).

- **Fix typo in CSS class**

In the template `src/view/frontend/templates/breadcrumbs.phtml`, the CSS class `nav-braincrumbs` now is correctly spelled `nav-breadcrumbs`.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #117](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/117).

### Removed

- **Removed classes, interfaces, methods, and properties**

A number of classes, interfaces, methods, and properties were removed.
However, we do not expect this to impact any customizations of Hyvä Checkout.

Removed classes:

- `\Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityField\Renderer\Regular` (replaced by `\Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityFormElement\Renderer\Element`)
- `\Hyva\Checkout\Model\Form\EntityFormFieldsFilterInterface` (no replacement as it was never used)

The removed properties and methods are not listed here.
Please refer to the [backward compatibility breaking changes in 1.1.0 document](https://docs.hyva.io/checkout/hyva-checkout/upgrading/upgrading-to-1.1.0-bc-breaks.html) for details.

## [1.0.7](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.6...1.0.7) - 2023-06-19

### Added

- Nothing added.

### Changed

- **Require Magewire 1.10.4**

From this release forward, Hyvä Checkout releases will depend on a specific Magewire version.
This will improve reliability and make future upgrades less complex.

For more information, please refer to [issue #125](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/125)

- **[Bugfix] Add missing resolver argument in di.xml to process hyva\_checkout.xml**

This change fixes a regeression introduced in release 1.0.6.
The issue caused additional hyva\_checkout.xml files not to be evaluated.

## [1.0.6](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.5...1.0.6) - 2023-06-09

### Added

- **Added Customer Address selection list view**

The default address selection with grid tiles was not ideal for stores where customers tend to have a lot of records
in their address book.
The list view address selection can be configured for a checkout in the system configuration at *Components >
Shipping* and *Components > Billing*.

For more information, please refer to [issue #64](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/64) and the
referenced merge requests.

### Changed

- **Display shipping totals in checkout with VAT**

Previously, the shipping totals were missing VAT if configured.

For more information, please refer to [issue #56](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/56).

### Removed

- Nothing removed.

## [1.0.5](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.4...1.0.5) - 2023-06-01

### Added

- **Allow saving of billing address to customer address book**

Previously this was only possible for shipping addresses.

Please refer to [issue #83](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/83) for more information.

- **"Weee tax" order totals renderer**

Please refer to [issue #100](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/100) for more information.

- **Option to add a subtitle and SVG logo icon to a Payment method**

It is now possible to add additional display information to payment methods using layout XML as "metadata".
For now, a subtitle and a payment provider logo SVG icon can be added. Additional properties might be added in the future.

Please refer to [issue #98](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/98) for more information.

- **Navigation button now can have nested elements**

This feature allows adding DOM elements, for example, SVGs, inside the navigation buttons.

Please refer to [issue #95](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/95) for more information.

- **Enable the Hyvä Checkout cache by default**

After running `bin/magento setup:upgrade` for the first time after installing the Hyvä Checkout 1.0.5 or newer, the
checkout cache will be automatically enabled.

Please refer to [issue #91](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/91) for more information.

### Changed

- **Fix phrase "No shipping address set." to "No shipping method selected." when no shipping method is selected**

Please refer to [issue #25](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/25) for more information.

- **Improve Discount Code component default styling**

We have tried to make the coupon code component less prominent, in other words, less visibly apparent. Both the field
and the apply button are now responsive to smaller viewports sizes.

Please refer to [issue #101](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/101) for more information.

- **2- and 3-columns checkout layout breakpoint revision**

Previously, the 2- and 3-column layout would break on medium-sized screens, but now it has been changed to break on
large screens instead. This change ensures better visibility on smaller screen sizes, such as mobile or tablet devices.

Please refer to [issue #101](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/101) for more information.

- **Default email sort order for shipping and billing form fields**

The email field will now have a default sort order to be rendered as the first field for both the shipping and billing
address forms.

Please refer to [issue #109](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/109) for more information.

- **Fixed an issue where it would not render a custom cart item type renderer when it was set via layout xml**

Please refer to [issue #110](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/110) for more information.

### Removed

- Nothing was removed.

## [1.0.4](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.3...1.0.4) - 2023-05-17

Release [1.0.1](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/tree/1.0.1) included a default totals renderer, which
caused a lot of issues. We announced in the Slack support channel that the default totals renderer will be removed
again in the next release. Now every total that needs to be rendered must be declared in layout XML as a child block of
`price-summary.total-segments`. The block alias must match the total code, as in `as="discount"`.

### Added

- **Address & Country change listeners for the payment method list**

By default, when an address is changed or a country is selected, the payment methods were not refreshed, potentially
leading to situations where payment methods needed to be displayed or hidden based on changes in the shipping or
billing address.

Please refer to [merge request #55](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/55) for more information.

Many thanks to Francesco Marangi (Y1) for the contribution!

- **Add checkout page type as widget instance target location**

Please refer to [issue #89](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/89) for more information.

- **Narrowed down the Composer PHP requirement between 7.4 and 8.3**

Please refer to [issue #88](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/88) for more information.

- **Checkout (Magewire) Component Resolver sort order**

You now possess the capability to decide whether your custom checkout component resolver should execute before or
after the core checkout component resolver. Previously, achieving this required utilizing a negative sort order in
the DI.xml file. However, you can now employ positive numeric values to precisely specify the desired position.

Please refer to [merge request #74](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/74) for more information.

### Changed

- **Fix scrolling in terms agreement dialog when the content exceeds page height**

On certain screen sizes, it was not possible to scroll within a terms agreement dialog when it was opened with a
context that exceeded the height of the screen. As a result, customers were unable to close the dialog since they
were unable to scroll to the bottom.

Please refer to [merge request #66](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/66) for more information.

Many thanks to Mitchel van Kleef (Made by Mouses) for the contribution!

- **Fix for using the undeclared function 'array\_first'**

Please refer to [merge request #93](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/93) for more information.

Many thanks to Adam Crossland (ZERO-1) for the contribution!

- **Empty Billing Address Form Replaces Pre-Filled Shipping Data**

Previously, a new guest billing address form would appear with pre-filled shipping address data that could be
modified. However, it has now been updated so that the billing address form opens empty, without any pre-existing
information.

Please refer to [issue #81](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/81) for more information.

### Removed

- **Removed the default total segment renderer (block) and its fallback mechanism**

In [merge request #44](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/44), a default total segment renderer was implemented to ensure that items are always rendered
without the need to manually add the necessary block into the Layout XML. However, this led to unintended behavior by
rendering items that should not be rendered, without providing the option to remove them, as it would default to the
standard rendering.

Please refer to [issue #87](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/87) for more information.

## [1.0.3](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.2...1.0.3) - 2023-05-09

### Added

- Nothing was added.

### Changed

- **Fix checkout layout resolver to only match on checkout route**

The layout resolver fix introduced in 1.0.2 matches any page on a store with Hyvä Checkout, causing non-checkout pages
using Magewire to break.

Please refer to [issue #58](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/85) for more information.

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing was removed.

## [1.0.2](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.1...1.0.2) - 2023-05-02

### Added

- Nothing was added.

### Changed

- **Fix unresolvable nested components**

Components that were dynamically loaded without a page reload or step navigation became unresolvable since the Hyva Checkout component ResolverInterface was unable to comply with its conditions and therefore would fallback on the default Magewire Layout ResolverInterface, which isn’t aware of any additional checkout/step layout handles. Because of this, Blocks couldn’t be found which result in Magewire throwing a 404 - component not found.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #57](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/57).

Many thanks to Ivascu Madalin (Buckaroo) & Filipe Bicho (Refusion) for the contribution!

### Removed

- Nothing was removed.

## [1.0.1](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1) - 2023-05-02

### Added

- **Compatibility with PHP 8.2**

For more information, please refer to [issue #35](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/35).

- **Default totals renderer**

Previously, custom totals where not rendered, unless they where explicitly added as a child to the `price-summary.total-segments` block with the total code as the block alias.
Now, if there is no child matching the total modal, the default renderer is used rendering the total code and value.

For more information, please refer to [issue #37](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/37).

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

### Changed

- **Fix shipping total rendering**

Previouly the shipping total was not shown because the block was missing the `as="shipping"` attribute in the layout xml, so it was rendered using the default total renderer instead.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #48](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/48).

Many thanks to Thijs de Witt (Trinos) for the contribution!

- **Changed the checkout cache ID from checkout to hyva\_checkout**

This low impact change was made to avoid potential cache key name collisions with other extensions or possible future Magento core changes.

For more information, please refer to [merge request #48](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/48).

- **Change type of Phone number field from "text" to "tel"**

This change can improve the keyboard layout on mobile devices when entering a value.

- **Session expiration Alert popup message**

When a customer session expires while idling for a long time during checkout, a informative message is displayed rather than an error message.

- **Fix validation error for newly registered customers without address in address book**

Previously, customers who had just created an account and tried to checkout where unable to place an order because the billing address was not properly initialized on the quote.

For more information, please refer to [issue #55](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/55).

Many thanks to Jacek Lopuszynski for the contribution!

- **Fix coupon code component being incorrectly disabled**

For more information, please refer to [issue #50](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/50).

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

- **Update README to refer to the correct composer package names**

Previously old package names used during development that are no longer valid where referenced in the README file.

For more information, please refer to [issue #43](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/43).

- **When a customer address is deleted, the address ID is removed from the quote**

Previously an exception was thrown when the address ID on the quote referenced a non-existing customer address.

For more information, please refer to [issue #39](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/39).

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

- **Update the price summary after changing the payment method**

Some payment methods like cash on delivery have an effect on the price summary.

Many thanks to Marcus Venghaus for the contribution!

- **Fix possible bypass of required form fields**

For more information, please refer to [issue #24](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/24) and [merge request #49](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/merge_requests/49).

- **Fix issue with Magewire loading spinner remaining visible after session timeout**

For more information, please refer to [issue #5](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/5).

- **Handle session corruption because of cookie domain conflicts more gracefully**

In the rare situation, where the main store is running on a second level domain (e.g. test.com),
and the staging environment was running on a subdomain of the same domain (e.g. staging.test.com),
the main store cookie conflicted with the subdomain cookie, resulting in lost sessions.
This caused a problem where the checkout was trying to collect Magewire components based on data of the main domain when on the subdomain.

For more information, please refer to [issue #42](https://gitlab.hyva.io/hyva-checkout/checkout/-/issues/42).

- **Select inputs like COUNTRY\_ID will now wait to update when a user starts typing**
